## Herb's granola

Herb loved to go to the health-food shop to get the ingredients. On long journeys, he had some granola in a container beside him and munched it.

I make this regularly, and use my own choice of extras, e.g. almonds, not peanuts.

## Rhea's bread

We tried this recipe when she visited us in Cambridge. It is unusual, but very good!

(Kibbled wheat – grains are cracked or broken into smaller particles and then moistened or steamed and dried. Kibbled wheat is used as an ingredient in mixed grain bread or cooked as a side dish.)

Translation:

1 cup kibbled wheat soaked in 1 cup boiling water\
Dissolve 1 oz fresh yeast in ½ cup warm water

To the kibbles, add:\
2 more cups of lukewarm water\
3 cups rye flour\
2 teaspoons salt\
2 cups porridge oats

Add the yeast mixture, stir and let rise for 2 hours. It should be juicy.

Add white flour – an equal amount to the rye flour.

Turn out on table, knead, shape, and let it rise until double the volume.

Sprinkle the loaf with water

Bake at 400^o^F – 200^o^C – Gas 5 for 45 minutes

(1 cup = 237 ml)
