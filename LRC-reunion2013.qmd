# LRC Reunion 2013

collated by *Dan Engstrom*

Many past and present members of the Limnoloigcal Research Center (LRC) met in August 2013 at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Minneapolis. During the meeting there was a morning symposium on 'Understanding the past to shape the future: a symposium honoring the contributions of Minnesota ecologists Margaret Davis, Eville Gorham, and Herb Wright'.

Below are some photographs taken by Dan Engstrom and others of the evening party, which was a wonderful reunion of the LRC.
