# Travelling with Herb - a picture gallery

by *Brigitta Ammann*

Herb was a great traveller and he always had at least two things with him in his mind and his (old) backpack: one or more interesting **scientific questions** and one or more manuscripts to edit.

## 1989

Informal discussions can help a lot, be it on scientific or personal levels.

## 1990

We Europeans used to think that forest fire was a phenomenon occurring only in Mediterranean and boreal regions but not in central Europe. Then Jim Clark, after completing his thesis in Minnesota, showed us that we were wrong (Clark et al. 1989). At Schleinsee, Jim Clark found a remarkable fire history! Herb asked question 1: **“Do you have a fire history in the Alps?”** The answer was: “Sorry, we do not know”. So Herb helped to write a proposal to the Swiss NSF – which enabled Willy Tinner  to work out the Holocene fire history for the southern Alps (Tinner et al. 1998, 1999) and  Madlena Beckmann reconstructed the fire history of the central-Alpine dry valley of Valais (Colombaroli et al. 2013).

My first of many visits to 1426 Hythe Street, St Paul – a wonderful place for MANY reasons.

## 1991

Herb started to like the “International Moor Excursions” initiated in 1975 by Gerhard Lang, described by Gerhard as: ”For advanced students”. But since the sentence “bonus vir semper student” is also valid for women, we all felt happy and inspired by these excursions (http://www.botany.unibe.ch/imoorex/index.php). This XV International Moor Excursion (IME) was led by Roel Janssen, Paula Queiros, José Mateus, Jacqueline van Leeuwen, and Pim van der Knaap. Herb asked question 2:  **What can we learn from steep gradients such as elevational transects? For example from the coast to the Serra de Estrela?**

![Herb and Andy Lotter listen to John Birks](images/clipboard-2462210897.png)

![John Birks](images/clipboard-2837876314.png)

Herb’s question 3: **How similar or how different are various amphi-atlantic phenomena (Wright 1977, 1989)?** And Herb discussed it with Gerhard Lang.

![Herb and Gerhardt Lang](images/clipboard-2841239493.png)

As a follow-up from question 2, Herb helped us to core five sites in the Central Alps in 1992 (from 600 to 2290 m a.s.l., Ammann et al. 2000).

## 1992

In 1992 we visited Andy Wright in Adelaide and enjoyed the beauties of the Australian south coast and canoeing on the Mighty Murray River.

## 1993

Herb’s first statement: “Dirk Verschuren needs a new core” – so we cored in the Crescent Island lake of Lake Naivasha (Verschuren et al. 2000). Herb’s second statement: ”Always keep the corer vertical”. We had to be back in camp by noon because the hippopotami become active and do not like shadows over their heads!

That same summer Herb also cored three lakes in the Slovak Tatra with Kamil Rybniček (Rybníčková & Rybníček 2006). During the excursion of the ‘History of Mountain Flora’ Conference to the Bulgarian Pirin Mountains, Herb stated: “These lakes deserve proper coring” – so he did in 1994, 2002, and 2006.

## 1994

This was the summer when Herb cored six lakes in five days in the Rila and Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria guided by Elisaveta Bozilova. We also travelled in Greece, e.g. to Githio in the southern Peloponnese. Herb’s fascination with the eastern Mediterranean possibly had its roots in his early work in the Levant: the coast of Lebanon (1947), Kurdistan (1961), Zagros Mountains (Wright et al. 1961, 1963, 1967, Stevens et al. 2001), Mycenaean Greece (1968), early food production in Mesopotamia (1968, 1970, 1976, 1993), the Minnesota Messenia expedition (1972) and more. Previously I had thought that “Kalamata” was just a very fine type of olive, but Herb showed me the place and the landscape with its great archaeology.1995

The Açores are in a way a stepping stone between North America and Europe and are biogeographically very special. On Flores, are two lakes – Lagoa Funda and Lagoa Rasa – which mean profound lake and shallow lake. Of course we could not core Lagoa Funda, but we did core Lagoa Rasa (second attempt in 1998; Connor et al. 2012).

![What secrets do these lakes on the Azores hold?](images/clipboard-3044512232.png)

Herb was always very strong in overcoming obstacles.

Since 1990 we enjoyed the serenity of the BWCA every summer.

## 1996

Jorge Rabassa in Ushuaia wanted a piston corer but did not want to pay for the air freight. Herb replied: “I no longer send corers by ship – but we will bring one!” Also in 1996: Herb receives his third Honorary Doctoral Degree – from University of Minnesota. The Moor Excursion went to Germany, led by T. Litt, S. Schloss, A. Hölzer, J. Kalis, M. Rösch et al.

Madeira, a beautiful crater lake became a reservoir :(

## 1998

Second coring trip to Georgia (Great Caucasus and Caucasus Minor)

First coring trip to the Russian Altai. Herb’s original question (no. 4) was based on his transatlantic interest: **In the Upper Mid-West of the US there was during the Holocene an east-west swing of the prairie-forest border. Were there similar changes in continental Eurasia?** Unfortunately the potential sites in the Kulundinskaya steppe were hopeless. So the question of the elevational gradients was addressed, as well as the fancy drowned pingos.

![Dzhangyskol with pingos (Blyakharchuk et al. 2008)](images/clipboard-262425315.png)

Questions 5 and 6 concern many landscapes with patterns: **What processes produce such patterns? At small spatial scales (e.g. pingos or patterned peatlands (see 2004)) and at large scales (e.g. the huge river terraces of the Katun River or the giant ripples in the Kuray Basin in the Altai)**. Ripples remind us of the Channelled Scablands in Washington US (picture in Wright 2005). Pavel Borodavko is a great geomorphologist and can explain the various hypotheses.

The 1998 Moor Excursion went to Ontario (guided by Jock McAndrews & Jean-Nicolas Haas).

![](images/clipboard-1536305529.png)

In September, a second coring trip to Lagoa Rasa on the Azores (Connor et al. 2012).

![Herb with André Pugin, Stéphanie Girardclos and Michael Wehrli](images/clipboard-204101156.png)

In 1998 Herb visited the famous Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland and its moraines of the Younger Dryas and 1850.

## 1999

This was a busy year. First, spring on La Palma together with Elisabeth Grönlund, working on texts.

![](images/clipboard-2515985922.png)

![](images/clipboard-1996890197.png)

Then coring in the Czech Republic

![Willy Tanner, Petr Pokorný and Herb in Svarzenberk](images/clipboard-1541157436.png)

A second trip to the Russian Altai in 1999, where we cored three sites close to the timberline: Uzun Kol (1985 m), Kedegelju (2050 m), and Tash Kol (2150 m) (Blykhartchuk et al. 2004). One evening when we were all sitting around the campfire one of the students asked me: “Is it not strange for the American professor to sit by an open fire?” No, he does that on at least 300 days of the year, be it indoors or outdoors!

![At Teplice Skalv](images/clipboard-2089209291.png)

![Around the campfire](images/clipboard-3583994601.png)

Near Uzun Kol we met N. Lashchinsky from Novosibirsk and three colleagues from Göttingen, B. Meyer, F. Lehmkuhl, F. Schlütz

Herb manages to communicate with his blue eyes and a smile!

In 1999Herb, Willy Tinner, and Petra Kaltenrieder core Grizzly Lake, Alaska (Tinner et al. 2006, 2008, 2015).

The 1999 Moor Excursion goes to The Netherlands. The most popular means of transport in this country is also used during the excursion. Bas van Geel was somewhat worried and asked: “Is it not too much for Herb?” Answer: “Herb is a more experienced biker than most of us – from Hythe Street to Pillsbury Hall he makes 2 x 7 km per day!

## 2000

January saw coring of West Twin and Steel Lake, Minnesota: August saw coring of Ak-Kol and Grusha in the Tuwa Republic, Siberia, \>2000 m a.s.l. - but not as cold as Minnesota! (Westover et al. 2006; Blyakhartchuk et al. 2007; Ilyashuk & Ilyashuk 2007; Stefanova & Oeggl 1993). The Moor Excursion went to the Southern Alps.

![Coring Lake Grusha](images/clipboard-222695404.png)

## 2001

More coring!

![Moody Lake in February](images/clipboard-1055391829.png)
