# Herb-Al

with *Allan Schneider*

Allan (Al) Schneider was one of Herb’s early PhD students and worked on Minnesota geology and history, and published a monograph of the Pleistocene geology of the Randal region of central Minnesota.

This first photo is of Herb with Al at the 2004 gathering of the Midwest Friends of the Pleistocene in Minnesota. Herb was 87 and Al 75. This meeting honoured them both as it was the 50^th^ anniversary of the 1954 Friends of the Pleistocene in central Minnesota that Herb and Al led.
