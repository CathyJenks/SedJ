    "title": "When Herb Wright had red hair: the fossil pollen years",
    "section": "",
    "text": "by John H. McAndrews\n\n\nHerb initiated the pollen lab in 1958 by combining Magnus Fries from Sweden with a Leitz Labolux microscope from Germany. Herb prepared for the pollen lab by publishing two review papers that featured pollen analysis (Wright 1957, 1961) and by attending John Rowley’s palynology lectures: he briefly looked at fossil pollen, but abandoned this dull exercise to the rest of us. Early graduate students included Ed Cushing, Lou Maher, Bob Bright, Dick Baker, Tom Winter, Barbara Spross, Tom Shay and me. At first, we collected sediment from sections (Jelgersma 1962, Farnham et al. 1963), but then we shifted to lake mud with its long postglacial pollen record. Influential visitors were Magnus Fries (pollen), Bill Watts (macrofossils), Willem van Zeist (Iran) and Roel Janssen (small, shallow sites).\nTwice Herb had me count pollen in surface samples. One summer he visited Bob Bright’s research area in Wyoming. On his all-night drive back to Minneapolis across the Great Plains, he stopped about every 20 miles and collected soil surface plant litter. Besides grass and sage pollen there was much pine and surprisingly some pollen from Douglas fir (McAndrews and Wright 1969). In 1963, Herb came through again with funding: I landed a postdoctoral position in the Netherlands – the problem was finding trans-Atlantic travel money. For this, he swung a grant from the US Office of Naval Research for the pollen analysis of soil surface samples from Iran of all places (Wright et al, 1967).\n\n\n\nFor field collection, at first we used the side-opening Hiller borer that was best suited for bog peat. For lake mud, we shifted to the end-opening stationary-piston corer pioneered by Dan Livingstone (Wright et al. 1965). Herb’s improvement featured a retractable rod that held the piston in the coring tube as the tube approached sampling depth. The first model had a round rod with a spring catch to hold the cocked rod before pushing down to fill the tube with mud. However, the catch often jammed so Herb invented the rotating square-rod model (Wright 1967). For the upper watery mud-water interface, we used the R-D piston sampler (Rowley and Dahl 1956), where friction rather than a rod held the piston stationary. The secret of getting a good core segment was to allow water in and out of the tube through a hole just below the top of the tube.\nHerb solved the problem of preserving laminations in the upper watery mud by freezing in place using dry ice. The first model was designed to freeze a core within a tube (Shapiro 1958): it turned out to be unworkable and so Herb had the idea of freezing a rind of mud around a tube filled with dry ice (Wright 1980). At Crawford Lake, Ontario, following Herb’s instructions, we built a freezing tube using a 3 m long irrigation pipe plugged at one end, filled it with dry ice and alcohol and capped it with a rubber glove that had a slit finger to release CO2 (McAndrews 1967). To this we attached a rope, and then cut a hole in the ice of Crawford Lake and launched the tube. It did not sink down to the mud, but just bobbed up and down; Herb forgot to tell us to add lead weights. This “frigid-finger” model has been replaced by a wedge-shaped “frigid finger-nail” of Scandinavian design. Crawford Lake turns out to have a varved pollen and macrofossil record of 15th century CE Iroquoian Landnam that was enhanced by roosting and defecating Canada Geese (McAndrews and Turton 2007).\n\n\n\nMinnesota’s Itasca Park has been a focus of fossil pollen-aided paleoecological research. This includes my dissertation work using pollen linked to the pre-settlement land survey (McAndrews 1966). The modern pine forest was preceded successively by mid-Holocene deciduous forest and then by arid prairie. In the Park, Tom Shay excavated a bison kill site dating to the early Holocene (Shay 1971). This was the background for the Elk Lake volume that featured multidisciplinary sediment studies (Bradbury and Dean 1993). Herb cored Elk Lake several times: once I experienced his wondrous persistence in the field. It was a late winter afternoon when we began coring. The weather was mild, around freezing, and the going was slow because of deep water. Several meters were landed before the sun set. “Don’t worry”, says Herb, “I have a flashlight”. Yes he did, but the batteries were dead. “Don’t worry,” says Herb, “I have matches”. So we land some more meters by match light. Then Herb runs out of matches. “Don’t worry” says Herb, “the moon is coming up”. So we land some more meters by moonlight. Then clouds obscured the moon and Herb reluctantly called it quits. Afterward, he complained that the published sediment chronology was inaccurate (if it were not for the clouds?).\n\n\n\nHerb rewrote my dissertation on the Itasca transect. It went like this; I would pencil and type a paragraph, then take it to Herb; he who would stop what he was doing, pencil-in corrections of syntax, gender, spelling, commas, verb agreement etc. and hand it back without comment. I would retype the corrected copy, hack out the next paragraph, and repeat the process. Two hundred and fifty-nine paragraphs later, I had a defensible dissertation. When it came to publishing it, I asked Herb if he wanted to be coauthor – he refused.\n\n\n\nIn 1962 he loaded Ed Cushing, Bill Watts, me and others into his 1950’s era station wagon and set out for the Palynology Congress in Tucson, Arizona. Ed and I added a can of gasoline to the load because the gas gauge was broken, the gas tank leaked and Herb’s estimate of gas in the tank was a some-time thing. In Nebraska, a front wheel began vibrating, spewing mud through a hole in the fender – it was not mud but rubber: we then stopped for a new wheel bearing and tire. On the way back, we collected a peat deposit on the Rosebud Indian Reservation (Watts and Wright 1966). After peat collection, the wagon had a flat. “No problem”, says Herb, “we have a spare”. Upon unloading sleeping bags and other camping impedimenta, there indeed was the spare, but there was no air in the spare. Herb, ever resourceful, flags down the next Indian pickup and throws the airless spare in the back. Before leaving in the pickup, he takes me aside, pulls out his wallet, pockets a five-dollar bill and hands me the wallet. An hour later the pickup returns with Herb and air in the spare. I give Herb his wallet back and we were off home to Minneapolis.\n\n\n\nHerb recommended me for my job in Toronto. After three years in the small-college wilderness, I landed at the Royal Ontario Museum analyzing pollen in mud of the Great Lakes. It turns out that the Great Lakes had low levels (Lewis et al. 2008) during the dry prairie period in Minnesota.\n\n\n\nFinally, I fondly remember Herb’s home seminars on topics Quaternary, e.g. Red Watson on mammoth and mastodon. At first, only five of we students attended, but as the years rolled by and red hair turned to gray, attendance grew to the point that Herb knocked down a wall to accommodate dozens of seminarians. Herb never had much to say, but he encouraged us to voice our ideas, particularly over his post-seminar chocolate-chip cookies and “Constant Comment” tea.\n\n\nBradbury, J.P. and Dean, W.E.

Afterward, he complained that the published sediment chronology was inaccurate (if it were not for the clouds?)."

Ed and I added a can of gasoline to the load because the gas gauge was broken, the gas tank leaked and Herb’s estimate of gas in the tank was a some-time thing. In Nebraska, a front wheel began vibrating, spewing mud through a hole in the fender – it was not mud but rubber: we then stopped for a new wheel bearing and tire. On the way back, we collected a peat deposit on the Rosebud Indian Reservation (Watts and Wright 1966). After peat collection, the wagon had a flat. “No problem”, says Herb, “we have a spare”. Upon unloading sleeping bags and other camping impedimenta, there indeed was the spare, but there was no air in the spare. Herb, ever resourceful, flags down the next Indian pickup and throws the airless spare in the back. Before leaving in the pickup, he takes me aside, pulls out his wallet, pockets a five-dollar bill and hands me the wallet. An hour later the pickup returns with Herb and air in the spare. I give Herb his wallet back and we were off home to Minneapolis."

    "text": "by Bob Baker\nI was Herb Wright’s TA for Glacial Geology for several years in the early 1970s and what follows are unique occurrences from his overnight trips.\n\n\nIn the fall of 1971 as the Glacial class was preparing for the first weekend trip, Herb instructed the class to bring appropriate camping gear and indicated that for the dinner Saturday night he would take care of the food and the students could reimburse him after the trip. \nNear the end of a long day, we stopped in Moose Lake, MN to gas up the vehicles and Herb disappeared into the town’s only grocery store.  He eventually emerged carrying two sacks of groceries and a large bag of potatoes.  We left Moose Lake, made one more geology stop and pulled into Jay Cooke State Park after dark – a tradition for the eastern field trip.  Students began setting up camp and several of us unpacked the groceries Herb had purchased in Moose Lake.  We discovered all the fixings for salad, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, etc., salad dressing, and to our surprise, about 12 whole chickens!  So here we were, well after sunset, with no charcoal for cooking potatoes or chicken and no knives to cut up the chicken.  After foraging for firewood, we got a fire built in one of the grills at the campsite, while several students made a huge salad that, in the absence of a mixing bowl was placed in a brown paper grocery bag.  The whole chickens were put on the grill, along with a number of potatoes.  Sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m., with the chicken still not completely cooked, I gave up and crawled into my tent for some needed sleep.  I heard in the morning that a few brave souls gave up on the chicken ever being cooked properly and ate it anyway, without adverse consequences.  Others followed my lead and went to bed having eaten salad only.\nThe next year Herb told me to take care of the food on this trip and I decided to make a huge pot of campfire chili, which, I was told, became a tradition for future overnight field trips that continued for a number of years.\n\n\n\nIn the fall of 1973, in addition to the usual mix of students enrolled in Herb’s Glacial class, there were several soil science students.  Whenever we stopped to examine a road cut, the soil science students would frequently challenge Herb in texturing the glacial sediments.  The students would use their well-calibrated fingers to texture and Herb would put a small amount of sediment in his teeth, which to everyone’s amazement were just as accurate. \nOn our western trip to the Minnesota River Valley, we stopped in the town of St. Rosa to look at an esker with a distinctive chocolate-brown till cap.  When we arrived at the exposure, Herb asked the class about the texture of the till cap, and some of the students picked up small amounts of till and began texturing it with their fingers.  After a few minutes, Herb asked a student to give him a sample of the till.  The student took his rock hammer, dug around in the till, and handed Herb a chunk on the end of the hammer.  Herb put the lump of till in his mouth and after chewing it for a few seconds, to everyone’s amazement, swallowed it whole!  Herb then proclaimed, “that’s pretty good till, do you have any more?” The student obliged and produced another good sized till chunk on his hammer.  Herb, once again wolfed it down.  At this point a number of students followed Herb’s lead and began texturing the till with their teeth.  I distinctly remember hearing the sound of feldspar grains cleaving in student’s teeth and many looked like youngsters who had been eating mud pies, with till smeared from ear to ear.\nSeveral years later I mentioned this episode to Herb and he admitted to me that the “till” samples handed to him on the rock hammer were actually brownies and that the entire episode was a well-choreographed setup.  I am sure that there are students who witnessed that event, who to this day are convinced Herb Wright consumed 4 to 5 ounces on glacial till, pebbles and all.\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of Herb Wright I always admired was his amazing tolerance for extreme weather conditions.  No matter how cold, windy, or rainy it was, Herb always seemed oblivious to the elements.\nAfter completing my degree at the University of Minnesota I began a long career teaching at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.  In the spring of 1982, I attended the Midwest Friends of the Pleistocene field trip in Burlington, IA with Herb, Ed Cushing, and one of Ed’s graduate students.  We camped at Geode State Park and slept under the stars the first night because the conditions were wonderful and no tents were needed. The second night when we arrived at our campsite, rather late after a banquet and a long program, we could see a storm rapidly approaching and decided to set up tents.  I got mine set up and Herb was still playing around with his.  I asked Herb if he needed assistance or wanted to share my tent and he stubbornly said that he had been given a new tube tent for Christmas and that setup should be simple.  I crawled into my tent and shortly all hell broke loose with lightning, deafening thunder, torrential rain, and hail.  The next morning I when I got up I discovered Herb sleeping in the vehicle.  He explained that he never figured out how to set up the tube tent before the storm hit, so he simply slipped it over his sleeping bag, much like one might do with a large garbage bag, and attempted to ride out the storm.  He said the hail bouncing off his eye sockets and teeth were tolerable, but the last straw was that the tube tent had completely filled with water because he was lying on a slope.  That was when I discovered that although Herb could tolerate almost any weather conditions, he drew the line at sleeping in the equivalent of a bathtub full of water."

    "text": "A Coring Expedition\nby Tom Shay\nBone-chilling winds whipped across the frozen pond as the two of us drilled through the thick ice with a hand-held auger. The leader of our little expedition was Dr Herbert Wright, then the director of the University of Minnesota’s Limnological Research Center. As a raw graduate student, I felt fortunate to work with such an experienced field researcher (by the early 1960s, Dr. Wright had cored a dozen lakes in Minnesota and elsewhere). But the weather was far from ideal. It was so cold that Dr Wright’s beard had turned white with frost. We looked like Arctic explorers, our breath forming crystals on our eyelashes and the fringes of our parkas. I still shudder whenever I think back to that freezing January day in 1961.\n\n\n\nTom Shay and Herb Wright coring ‘Qually Pond’, north-west Minnesota, January 1961\n\n\nThe effort was strenuous so we took turns cranking the auger. Its spoon-shaped blade made a crackling sound as it drilled through the crystal-clear ice. The blade finally poked through the thick mass as steam rose from the water below. Sigh of relief. We could now proceed with our mission.\nOur mission was to collect a core of bottom mud from the pond for pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. The mission seemed laudable but why choose a frigid Sunday in January? Why were we braving such weather in order to collect lake mud when, months later, we could have returned in shirtsleeves? The answer is simple. Stability. Anyone who has tried to collect a core from a bobbing boat knows how difficult it is. Years of experience show that lake cores are best obtained from a stable platform. In open water you could use a pontoon but there is no more stable platform than an ice surface. In spite of the weather, the ice offered us the platform we needed. Nevertheless, we could have chosen a warmer weekend.\nOnce the auger had poked through the ice, we inserted our coring tube into the hole. This was the first step in collecting mud from the small pond we named Qually after the property owners. We used a piston sampler, developed by the distinguished paleolimnologist Dan Livingstone. Our Livingstone corer resembled an outsized hypodermic syringe, consisting of a long, hollow steel tube about the diameter of a fist, with an inner rubber piston inside. The piston rose up the tube as mud entered the bottom. To lower and raise it out of the water, we attached lengths of lead pipe to the top of the tube. Because our muscle-power was not up to the job, we pushed and pulled the corer in and out with the aid of a metal frame and two chain hoists.\nTo begin, we lowered the sampler through the water and pushed it into the mud until we had filled the tube. Then we hoisted the sampler out of the water, laid it on the ice, and used the rubber piston to push out the dark organic-rich “sausage” onto a stout piece of aluminium foil. I wrapped the segment and taped it closed, using a felt tip marker to write its depth range and an arrow pointing to the top of the segment. We continued to add additional sections of lead pipe for subsequent drives until we hit sand, signalling we had reached the bottom.\nWhen we laid the last segment on the ice, we couldn’t push out the core inside. The mud had frozen solid in the tube. After some discussion, we collected our gear, trudged back to Dr Wright’s battered station-wagon and drove in search of a garage where we could thaw the frozen tube. We finally found someone willing to help us. A few minutes later, we watched while the overall-clad mechanic played his blowtorch over the frozen tube, slowly warming it enough for us to push out its muddy contents. After wrapping and labelling it, we transferred our precious cargo onto the long, wooden tray with the other core samples for the ride back to Minneapolis. To add to our day’s adventures, on the way home the old car’s heater failed, forcing me to hunch in my seat and wiggle my toes inside my boots to keep warm. But, I didn’t mind the cold—I was busy planning how to begin my pollen study!\nAlthough hand corers are still being used for collecting lake mud, today’s coring devices are far more sophisticated. Modern corers are capable of obtaining 70 mm cores in plastic liners up to 14 m long from water depths greater than 30 m."

    "text": "by John Birks\n\n\nAfter my post-graduate year in 1970 in the LRC (with Hilary) and time at the LRC after the Klutlan Glacier expedition in 1971, I did not return to the LRC until 1975. I subsequently spent around 2–3 weeks there every April until 1982 pollen counting, using the reference collections, meeting new students (e.g. Dan Engstrom, David Foster, Sheri Fritz, Eric Grimm, George Jacobson, George King), discussing new ideas with Herb, Ed Cushing, and fellow visitors Bill Watts and Roel Janssen, and, of course, sediment coring, including collecting cores from some lakes that we were unsure of where there were because Herb had left the USGS maps behind in Pillsbury Hall! All my fieldwork experience with Herb until 1979 had been on frozen lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, or North Dakota or shallow ponds on the Klutlan Glacier in the Yukon Territory.\n\n\n\nWhen Bill Watts suggested a coring trip to Bermuda in April 1979, I jumped at the chance to go as a ‘field helper’ with Bill and Herb. Bill’s interest in Bermuda was that it is the northernmost locality for the mangrove species Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans, and Conocarpus erectus and that its native vegetation prior to human impact was dominated by the endemic Juniperus bermudiana and the endemic palm Sabal blackburnianum – a most unusual palynological mix!\n\n\n\nBermuda\n\n\n\n\n\nJuniperus-Sabal vegetation\n\n\nThe three of us flew from the Twin Cities to Atlanta (Georgia) with corers, rods, etc., all wrapped up as single pieces of checked-in luggage and chain hoists as hand-baggage. After landing at Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda, we loaded up a taxi with our equipment and asked to go to the Bermuda Marine Biological Station (now the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences) where Herb had arranged ‘accommodation’ for us. When we reached the Station, Herb suggested to me as Bermuda is ‘British’, the taxi-driver will need to be paid in UK pounds and Herb looked at me to pay. The taxi-driver quickly intervened and said “No man! We do not use them things as they are worthless. We only use real money – dollars!” So Herb had to find his wallet! In fact, Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory and its currency is the Bermuda dollar that is pegged to the US dollar.\nGoogle describes working at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences today as a ‘once in a lifetime experience’. Staying in the ‘accommodation’ that Herb had arranged in 1979 certainly was a ‘once in a lifetime experience’ – dirty with broken windows, masses of cockroaches and mosquitoes, and decaying mattresses would not entice anyone to stay a second time. Bill immediately went to see the administration and we were upgraded from a zero-star room to two-star room! Bill also arranged for us to borrow a boat for coring, as the lakes in Bermuda were not ice-covered and Herb had not brought a boat with him.\nUsing taxis as our means of transport, we visited and tried to core four sites – Devonshire Marsh, Pembroke Marsh, Mangrove Lake, and Lover’s Lake.\n\n\n\nDevonshire Marsh\n\n\n\n\n\nPembroke Marsh\n\n\nWe failed miserably at Devonshire Marsh where over 30 m of fibrous peat had been reported. Needless to say, an in-need-of-much-repair square-rod Wright corer with a blunt cutting edge and no lockable square-rod failed totally and we left the Marsh with four sediment slugs of about 20 cm length of no possible scientific value. Bill and I botanised on the Marsh and found nice plants of Osmunda cennamonea, Myrica cerifera, and several Carex and Cyperus species. We also tried coring the nearby Pembroke Marsh without any success at all.\n\n\n\nMangrove Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nLover’s Lake\n\n\nNext day we turned our attention to the few natural lakes on Bermuda, in particular Mangrove Lake. This is a small (1 ha) and shallow lake with a belt of Rhizophora red mangroves at the margins. It is surrounded in part by a golf course on dune-like hills and whilst we were coring, we heard golf-balls fall into the lake! It is separated from the sea by a ridge though which seawater and even tidal movements can penetrate (Watts & Hansen 1986). We raised over 15 m of sediment from under 160 cm of water. The sediments were like ‘rubber-mud’ wit sections of green, brown, or black banded layers, often with shells. The basal 3 m were brown fibrous hardened peat. The coring was surprisingly uneventful and the core extended to nearly 10,000 years ago. Barbara Hansen’s (Watts & Hansen 1986) pollen analyses show that the Holocene vegetation was dominated by Juniperus and Sabal. Pollen of plants that occur today in tropical southern Florida (e.g. Acrostichum fern) an south into the West Indies were present in the early Holocene. The mangroves Rhizophora and Conocarpus arrived on Bermuda in the late Holocene.\n\n\n\nBill Watts and the Mangrove Lake top core\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright at Mangrove Lake\n\n\nLover’s Lake was difficult to reach because of its dense mangrove margins. Its sediments of about 1 m (mainly volcanic tephra) under 1 m of water were not worth the effort of getting them!\nBermuda was a fun trip – strange flora and vegetation, unusual lakes with unusual sediments, lovely bird fauna and the endemic Diamondback Terrapin in Mangrove Lake, curious mixture of British and American cultures, and surprisingly few coring or survival adventures.\n\n\n\nIn March 1980, I was fortunate to join Herb and Bill on a coring trip to northern Florida. The major aim was to try to obtain a longer and hence older core from Sheelar Lake near Gainesville in the Gold Head Branch State Park. Bill had previously obtained a 19 m sediment core from under 18 m of water and this core had provided a near-continuous pollen record extending back 24,000 years. Bill was keen to obtain an older record that could provide information about the origin and development of species-rich mesic deciduous forest in northern Florida (Watts 1980; Watts & Stuiver 1980).\nHerb, as usual, insisted that he would ‘organise’ the coring equipment, the field-camp gear, and the food – dreadful mistakes on the part of Bill and me! We flew to Gainesville via Atlanta. As we were coming into land at Atlanta, the plane made a very steep sudden ascent, so steep that Herb stopped editing the manuscript he was working on and looked over his glasses. The pilot announced in a characteristic southern drawl “Gee folks, sorry about that but someone was trying to share the runway with us!” We safely reached Gainesville and we stayed with Tom Crisman, a former LRC post-doc. Next day we went to the Florida Museum of Natural History to meet Ed Deevey, a long-term friend of Herb’s and to beg or borrow two substantial boats to make a coring platform, some anchors, cross-ropes, etc. that Herb had forgotten to bring! After a delightful supper with Ed and his wife Georgiana at their lovely home by Lake Alice with its ospreys and alligators, we drove to the Gold Head Branch State Park and sat up our camp for several nights. Bill and I soon discovered what Herb had brought for our field-camp – no tents, three worn-out sleeping-bags, some plastic cups, bowls, and plates, a few broken plastic spoons, knives, and forks, and a half-empty packet of corn flakes. Bill was furious!\n\n\n\nLake Alice\n\n\n\n\n\nLake Alice alligators\n\n\nAs it was getting dark, we rolled out our sleeping-bags. I noticed that Herb had found a dip in the surrounding sand and settled down in it. I started to follow but Bill whispered to me, “Not there! It’s an alligator’s trail. Herb will not be there in the morning!” Bill was right: Herb had moved his sleeping area by the morning. Breakfast was a silent affair – corn flakes and water and some weak tea were not the most exciting start to a long day’s coring in hot conditions. Bill, resourceful as ever, suggested Herb organise the boats and coring equipment while Bill and I drive into town and get some proper supplies. When we returned, Bill discovered that Herb had brought the most dilapidated, barely functional corer with not enough piston wire for 40+ m of water, some rods that did not fit together, not enough plastic or aluminium foil to wrap the cores in, and no water-depth gauge! Most atypically, Bill really lost his temper with Herb – the only time I ever saw Bill lose his temper in the 40 years that I knew him. Herb was silent and disappeared into town to find a hardware store, his saving grace on so many coring (mis)adventures.\nAfter a good field lunch, thanks to Bill’s and my shopping, we set forth to the centre of Sheelar Lake for a long coring campaign. Besides Bill, Herb, and me, Sam Garnett-Jones, a post-doc of Ed Deevey, joined us. With 18 m of water and 18 m of casing, raising a 1 m core segment was an effort. By the end of the first day we had raised 12 m of sediment and we were tired. A spectacular sight was ospreys fishing in the lake and alligators in shallow waters at the lake’s edge in the early dusk.\n\n\n\nSheelar Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nThree men on a raft\n\n\n\n\n\nQuercus laurifolia - Q. virgininiana fringe at Sheelar Lake\n\n\nWe experienced a typical Florida thunderstorm that evening, so we drove to a nearby restaurant for supper. Famished, Bill and I ordered large T-bone steaks with French fries, whilst Herb ordered a baked potato! The waitress looked at Herb and asked “What’s wrong with you, Beardie?” Herb very quietly said “I am in Florida”. End of conservation.\nNext day we continued coring operations and the effort involved getting an extra metre of sediment increased as we had to keep adding casing. By 5 p.m. we had raised an additional 8 m of sediment and everything was going wrong – corer catching on the casing, casing and rods bending, lack of drive-force, and so on. We tried chain-hoists (brought by Herb as carry-on baggage) and perhaps penetrated a further 10 cm. Eventually we gave up, having only obtained an extra 110 cm of sediment to Bills original 1900 cm. In the dusk, we enjoyed watching the ospreys as we dismantled the coring platform, had a decent camp meal (Herb had a cold baked potato), and an uneventful night’s sleep.\nDuring the next day, Bill introduced me to the flora and vegetation of the Gold Head Branch State Park of Pinus palustris, Quercus laevis, and a range of other oaks, many shrubs (e.g. Myrica cerrifera, Lyonia lucida, L. ferruginea), small palms, and heaths such as Ceratiola ericoides. A deep fire-protected ravine nearby supported a luxuriant mesic tree flora of Corya glabra, Liquidambar styraciflora, and Magnolia grandiflora, with a fine understorey of palms (Sabal palmetto, Serenoa reprens). I saw many unusual plants new to me including several insectivorous plants, strange ferns, palms, and climbers. It was my first (and last) encounter with New World sub-tropical vegetation.\n\n\n\nGold Head Branch State Park\n\n\nWe then moved north in search of potential coring sites. That night, Bill drove us into a motel and booked a room for three people – Herb said two people; he was going to sleep out! Bill said nothing and after supper (Herb was now addicted to baked potatoes), Bill and I retired to bed. Bill fully locked our room. I asked “Is this because we are in Florida?” Bill answered, “No, it is to keep Herb out! He has not seen the weather forecast of major storms.” Sure enough at about 4 a.m. a very wet Herb was knocking on our door!\nWe visited the Torreya State Park along the Apalichola River and saw wonderful mesic forest wit Rhadidophyllum hystrix in opening, and Nyssa sylvatica floodplain forest. On the return from the Park, we stopped at a petrol station. Whilst Bill and I were filling up the monster vehicle, Herb went to a phone-booth to make a call. The garage proprietor’s dog went after him and started to pull at his trousers. The proprietor said to us, not realising that Herb was part of our group, “She is a damn good dog – hates hippies like that” pointing to Herb.\n\n\n\nMesic forest with Rhapidophyllum in openings, Torreya State Park\n\n\n\n\n\nNyssa sylvatica floodplain forest\n\n\nWe tried several other lakes, but with little success – Deer Lake, Clear Lake, Camel Pond, and Lake Hall. This gave me the chance to see more of Florida’s vegetation and flora that I had read about in Bill’s papers about Lake Annie, Mud Lake, and Lake Louise, such as Ceratiola erocoides heath on sand-dunes, many different Pinus species (P. clausa, P. taeda, P. elliottii), and Taxodium distichium swamps at Manatee Springs.\n\n\n\nSeranoa repens fringe, Deer Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Watts in pine wood by Camel Pond\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall hollow dominated by Wolfia duckweed, Manatee Springs\n\n\nIt was a really wonderful trip, despite the problems with field-camping, coring equipment, and tough sediments, and the “I am in Florida” attitude of Herb. I learnt a huge amount about open-water coring which has served me in very good stead in the last 30 years. I saw many new plants and vegetation thanks to Bill’s knowledge and generosity. Moreover I acquired a huge admiration for the work that Bill had done and went on to do on the vegetation history of the south-eastern United States. Nothing is easy there – good sites are rare, coring is difficult, the flora and its pollen flora are challenging, and interpretation can be difficult. I also realised what a remarkable pair of opposites Herb and Bill made in the field, both determined to find good sites and obtain good cores but how they went about fieldwork was somewhat contrasting!\n\n\nWatts WA.

We tried chain-hoists (brought by Herb as carry-on baggage) and perhaps penetrated a further 10 cm. Eventually we gave up, having only obtained an extra 110 cm of sediment to Bills original 1900 cm. In the dusk, we enjoyed watching the ospreys as we dismantled the coring platform, had a decent camp meal (Herb had a cold baked potato), and an uneventful night’s sleep.\nDuring the next day, Bill introduced me to the flora and vegetation of the Gold Head Branch State Park of Pinus palustris, Quercus laevis, and a range of other oaks, many shrubs (e.g. Myrica cerrifera, Lyonia lucida, L. ferruginea), small palms, and heaths such as Ceratiola ericoides. A deep fire-protected ravine nearby supported a luxuriant mesic tree flora of Corya glabra, Liquidambar styraciflora, and Magnolia grandiflora, with a fine understorey of palms (Sabal palmetto, Serenoa reprens). I saw many unusual plants new to me including several insectivorous plants, strange ferns, palms, and climbers. It was my first (and last) encounter with New World sub-tropical vegetation.\n\n\n\nGold Head Branch State Park\n\n\nWe then moved north in search of potential coring sites. That night, Bill drove us into a motel and booked a room for three people – Herb said two people; he was going to sleep out! Bill said nothing and after supper (Herb was now addicted to baked potatoes), Bill and I retired to bed. Bill fully locked our room. I asked “Is this because we are in Florida?” Bill answered, “No, it is to keep Herb out! He has not seen the weather forecast of major storms.” Sure enough at about 4 a.m. a very wet Herb was knocking on our door!\nWe visited the Torreya State Park along the Apalichola River and saw wonderful mesic forest wit Rhadidophyllum hystrix in opening, and Nyssa sylvatica floodplain forest. On the return from the Park, we stopped at a petrol station. Whilst Bill and I were filling up the monster vehicle, Herb went to a phone-booth to make a call. The garage proprietor’s dog went after him and started to pull at his trousers. The proprietor said to us, not realising that Herb was part of our group, “She is a damn good dog – hates hippies like that” pointing to Herb.\n\n\n\nMesic forest with Rhapidophyllum in openings, Torreya State Park\n\n\n\n\n\nNyssa sylvatica floodplain forest\n\n\nWe tried several other lakes, but with little success – Deer Lake, Clear Lake, Camel Pond, and Lake Hall. This gave me the chance to see more of Florida’s vegetation and flora that I had read about in Bill’s papers about Lake Annie, Mud Lake, and Lake Louise, such as Ceratiola erocoides heath on sand-dunes, many different Pinus species (P. clausa, P. taeda, P. elliottii), and Taxodium distichium swamps at Manatee Springs.\n\n\n\nSeranoa repens fringe, Deer Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Watts in pine wood by Camel Pond\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall hollow dominated by Wolfia duckweed, Manatee Springs\n\n\nIt was a really wonderful trip, despite the problems with field-camping, coring equipment, and tough sediments, and the “I am in Florida” attitude of Herb. I learnt a huge amount about open-water coring which has served me in very good stead in the last 30 years. I saw many new plants and vegetation thanks to Bill’s knowledge and generosity. Moreover I acquired a huge admiration for the work that Bill had done and went on to do on the vegetation history of the south-eastern United States. Nothing is easy there – good sites are rare, coring is difficult, the flora and its pollen flora are challenging, and interpretation can be difficult. I also realised what a remarkable pair of opposites Herb and Bill made in the field, both determined to find good sites and obtain good cores but how they went about fieldwork was somewhat contrasting!\n\n\nWatts WA.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Herb Wright and COHMAP: 1974-1994\nby Tom Webb and John Kutzbach\nIt all seems only fitting that Herb was the lead editor for Global Climates Since the Last Glacial Maximum, published by the University of Minnesota Press in 1993, and shared in the editorial duties for the COHMAP’s Science article in 1988—two of the culminating syntheses of what COHMAP grew into after its humble beginnings in 1974, when we two with Herb and Ed Cushing first broached the subject of cooperating in research at the AMQUA meeting in Madison, inspired by CLIMAP’s model for interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research about Quaternary climates. Although COHMAP, like CLIMAP, fairly soon became international in focus—initially by teaming up with Alayne Street-Perrott, who had begun compiling a global data base of lake-level data—in its original phase, COHMAP proposed to map only the climates and vegetation of eastern North America for the past 16,000 calendar years with a particular focus in central and northeastern US – areas familiar to Herb both from field work, Friends of the Pleistocene trips, and the writing of review articles.\nAs PhD students under Reid Bryson, we both became intrigued by late Quaternary climates and how the mapped synoptic patterns of past climates had changed in response to various forcings, which came to be represented as a set of changing boundary conditions in global climate models. CLIMAP’s lead in showing the importance of orbital forcing over the past 400,000 years and their modeling of the last glacial maximum world stimulated us to apply their methods and approach to late-Quaternary climates. In doing so, we quickly realized that we needed to expand our focus from the Midwest and eastern North America and assemble global data sets for checking the model results. Herb and colleagues’ work in the Limnological Research Center (LRC) as well as his trans-Atlantic connections made him an excellent collaborator in such a grandiose project. For example, the Huntley and Birks (1983) atlas of European pollen data was an important contribution to the COHMAP global data set, and in the late 1970s, John Birks was an annual visitor at the LRC. In the effort to build a comparable set of pollen data for North America, a strong link to the LRC and Herb’s record of sharing data was crucial. That the Radiocarbon Lab at the Center for Climatic Research would provide dates for LRC cores at low prices was one of many attractions to Herb for teaming up with us. We therefore found a number of mutual benefits to working together right from the get-go.\nBut it was at the personal level that things took off for us in COHMAP. As one of us (JEK) recalls on first meeting him, “I saw that spark of contagious curiosity that he exhibited and I now recognize how it energized our meetings and scientific discussions. Thinking specifically of climate, but I suspect it applies to all areas, I always had the clear sense that Herb had his own well-thought-out views of how things worked, based on reading and reflection. However, he was always open and asking probing questions to learn more. His quiet questioning of our climatic reasoning helped me to clarify my own thinking and to organize my thoughts into clearer narratives. \n“His vast knowledge of the Quaternary landscape and its evolution always allowed him to expand our thinking to encompass the largest possible geographic and temporal range of ideas and ‘thought models’. For example, we might have had a productive lengthy discussion on a particular region, say the eastern US, and when that topic seemed momentarily exhausted, Herb could gently turn our attention to an entirely different region or time, e.g. the southeast, or the southwest, or Europe or the Middle East, etc. In this amazing way, we always covered a much wider range of topics and ‘uncovered’ new things to think about during our informal small-group discussions that so fueled COHMAP’s emergence as a key program in global climate research.\n“I suppose our winter meetings at Herb’s home stick permanently in my mind when I reflect on the milieu in which we worked. I remember how Al Swain took me aside before our first winter meeting and warned me to pack long underwear and layers of sweaters—advice for which I’m still grateful. I recall indoor temperatures well below my comfort level both night and day, and being grateful for the blazing fire. Even so, I think my core temperature lowered gradually over the course of our visits and only fully recovered when I was back home in Madison. \n“I also recall one visit when we arrived about the same time that a large load of wood was being delivered. It seemed completely natural that the first order of business was to get that wood into the house through a basement window, and properly stacked. It’s great to recall how in this case some mundane chore came naturally before thinking, and we had the additional incentive of knowing we would later reap the benefits of warmth. \n“There was a unique pace to life and science in Herb’s home. Breakfast happened gradually with those first smells and taste of tea, of bread in the oven, and so on. Only gradually would we move to the fireside and commence our sessions.  There was also a special deliberate pace to the afternoons and evenings, or evening seminars. Never hurried, but always plenty of time. It was a bit like the slow movement of a symphony, but always with expectation.  I think this patient pace was a part of Herb’s genius for science, and for people, and that a faster tempo would not have been nearly as creative or effective.”\nWhat Herb fostered was a cooperative spirit in doing science and investigating late Quaternary landscapes and environments. We were lucky to share similar interests about past climates and vegetation and to offer complementary skills and training for assembling the data and modeling the processes. During our twenty years of working together in COHMAP, our differing perspectives and knowledge kept us talking and educating each other. All the while, the twinkle in Herb’s eye was there to guide us toward new challenges."

    "text": "by John Birks\nDuring his PhD studies in New Mexico in the early 1940s, Herb Wright developed a keen interest in lakes and their sediments as a potential source of information for inferring relative chronologies and vegetational, environmental, and climatic history. His initial awareness of the potential of pollen analysis in reconstructing landscape and climatic history probably came from his Harvard mentor Kirk Bryan Sr (1888–1950) who closely followed the ever-growing European literature on pollen analysis and climatic history in the 1940s. Herb’s interest was further stimulated by Edward S Deevey (1914 – 1988) with the publication of his masterly review of Pleistocene biogeography (Deevey 1949), by his own geo-archaeological research in the Near East and studies on the glacial history of Minnesota in the early 1950s, and by his visits to the leading European centres for Quaternary geology and for pollen analysis. Herb met many of the leaders in European pollen analysis in the 1950s including Johannes (Johs) Iversen (1904–1972) and Svend Th Andersen (1926–2009) in Copenhagen, Tage Nilsson (1905–1986) in Lund, Gunnar Erdtman (1897–1973) in Stockholm, Knut Fægri (1909–2001) in Bergen, Max Welten (1904–1984) in Bern, Franz Firbas (1902–1964) in Göttingen, and Harry Godwin (1901–1985) in Cambridge.\nThanks to a grant from the Hill Family Foundation in St Paul in 1956, Herb was able to establish in 1958 a pollen laboratory within the then Department of Geology, University of Minnesota. As Herb admitted (Wright, unpublished ‘Wengen’) “Not being an avid microscopist, I called upon experienced European specialists to establish a pollen laboratory at Minnesota and to help in advising students”. Herb explained “In order to introduce new ideas and well-trained specialities to the activities of the Limnological Research Center (LRC), policy of inviting post-doctoral research fellows and research associates for 1–2 years has been followed. Many of these persons come from active laboratories in foreign countries. Several have returned for subsequent visits and have maintained joint research projects” (Wright 1969). This account is about the thirteen European specialists who worked for a year or more in the laboratory at Herb’s invitation between 1958 and 1968 – the palaeoecological ‘pioneers’.\nThe first members of the embryonic pollen laboratory were Herb and two graduate students Edward (‘Ed’) J Cushing who joined in 1956 and John (‘Jock’) H McAndrews who joined in 1957, along with one Leitz microscope and a minute preparation laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Cushing\nJock McAndrews\nMagnus Fries\n\n\n\nHerb sought advice from Johs Iversen, who was on leave at Yale University in 1956, about which European palynologist to invite to Minnesota and help develop the pollen lab and train and advise talented graduate students such as Ed Cushing and Jock McAndrews. Iversen recommended Magnus Fries (1917–1987) from Uppsala, as an ideal teacher, a meticulous pollen analyst, hard-working, and a kind and very likable person. Magnus came from a distinguished lineage of Swedish botanists including the mycologist Elias Fries, the lichenologist Thore M. Fries, and the taxonomist Robert Fries (Santesson 1987). Magnus was the leading Quaternary pollen analyst in Sweden in the 1950s. He defended his doctoral thesis in 1951 (Fries 1951) on the vegetational history of Västergötland in southern Sweden. He published several important papers about Swedish vegetational history (e.g. Fries 1962a, 1965, 1980). Whilst in Minnesota in 1958, he helped to develop the pollen lab (including getting a second Leitz microscope), to build up its modern pollen reference collections, and to teach and advise Ed Cushing and Jock McAndrews, as well as three MSc students – Harvey Patten, Thomas (Tom) C. Winter (1936–2010), and Anne Knight – and two PhD students – Louis (Lou) J. Maher and Robert (Bob) C. Bright (1928–1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Winter\nLou Maher\nBob Bright\n\n\n\nMagnus also did a detailed pollen-stratigraphical study at Weber Lake, north-east Minnesota (Fries 1962b; Eisenack & Fries 1965) as well as a study of a late Wisconsin buried peat at North Branch on the Anoka sandplain just north of the Twin Cities (Fries et al. 1961). The influence of Magnus on the laboratory and on its students was immense. He shared the same work-ethic as Herb and the students – hard work, long hours, natural curiosity, generosity, and determination. He is warmly acknowledged in all the doctoral and MSc theses. Several major papers were derived from these theses including Winter (1962), Maher (1963), Wright et al. (1963), Cushing (1964), and McAndrews (1966). Magnus greatly enjoyed his year in Minnesota (Fries 1962c). I only met Magnus once, in May 1977 in Lund, and he was very keen to hear news of the LRC, the pollen lab, Herb, Ed, Jock, and others. Magnus became Assistant Professor in the Department of Forest Botany in the Royal College of Forestry in the early 1960s. A new position was created for him in July 1978 in the Section of Palaeobotany of the Swedish Museum of Natural History to provide scientific leadership for Index Holmiensis – a project started by Hans Tralau (1932–1977) to create a world index of plant distribution maps. Ten volumes have been published to date covering pteridophytes, gymnosperms, monocotyledons, and dicotyledons to the letter S. Volume 10 (dicotyledons Q–S) with data about maps for 19,798 taxa was published in 2007. Magnus also played an important role in the completion of the mammoth three-volume Atlas of North European Vascular Plants (Hultén & Fries 1986).\nMagnus Fries was, in many ways, the ‘father’ of pollen analysis in Minnesota as he did so much to develop the pollen lab, to train and advise many talented graduate students in the field and the lab, and to explore the vegetational history of north-east Minnesota. He suggested that Ed Cushing apply for a Fulbright Fellowship to work in what was then the Geological Survey of Denmark. Ed worked there in 1960–61 and greatly benefitted from daily contact with Johs Iversen and Svend Andersen (Cushing 1963). Ed imported into the pollen lab much of what he had learnt whilst in Copenhagen and set the very high laboratory and analytical procedures and intellectual rigour that quickly became the norm in the Minnesota pollen lab.\nMagnus was followed by Saskia (‘Kiek’) Jelgersma (1929–2012), a Quaternary geologist from The Netherlands. Kiek’s primary research for her doctoral thesis in 1961 was on Holocene sea-level changes in The Netherlands. This work involved pollen analysis, stratigraphy, archaeology, and radiocarbon dating. After her year (1959–60) in Minnesota she was appointed Senior Geologist in the Geological Survey of The Netherlands in Haarlem, a post she held until her retirement in 1995. Whilst in Minnesota she helped to develop further the pollen lab, to advise graduate students, and to study late-glacial deposits at Madelia in south-central Minnesota (Jelgersma 1962) and Kotiranta Lake, north-eastern Minnesota (Wright & Watts 1969).\nThe next visiting researcher to the pollen lab was also from The Netherlands, Willem van Zeist (1924–2016) from the Biologisch-Archaeologisch Institutut, University of Groningen. Willem’s major research interests were in archaeological botany and palaeo-ethnobotany and his expertise included pollen analysis, macroscopic plant remains, and charcoal remains. Besides working in The Netherlands and in France, his major research areas were the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean. As well as helping in the pollen lab and interacting with graduate students, Willem’s main research was to study the pollen stratigraphy of cores I-13 and I-12 from Lake Zeribar in the Zagros Mountains of south-western Iran (van Zeist & Wright 1963). Herb had obtained these cores in 1960 with Richard (‘Red’) Watson, Anne Bent, and Richard (‘Dick’) Wright (Wright 2008). These cores extended to about 17,000 years before present and provided the incentive for further work at Zeribar and the first hints of the importance of Late Pleistocene/early Holocene climate changes from dry and cold to moist and temperate (Wright 1966) on the origins of agriculture (Wright 1964). Herb and Willem returned to Zeribar in 1963 with Robert (‘Bob’) and Roberta (‘Bobbi’) Megard and Dick Wright. Results for the pollen, plant macrofossil, and cladoceran stratigraphies of the 1963 cores were published by van Zeist (1967), Wasylikowa (1967), and Megard (1967). In addition, 72 modern surface samples were collected along transects crossing the major vegetation belts. The pollen in these samples were analysed by Jock McAndrews whilst a post-doctoral fellow at Groningen (Wright et al. 1967).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskia Jelgersma\nWillem van Zeist\n\n\n\nLou Maher and Bob Bright followed Ed and Jock to be post-doctoral fellows in Europe, Lou in Cambridge and Bob in Uppsala, consolidating the strong and valuable trans-Atlantic connections that Herb and Magnus Fries initiated in 1958. These connections were continued with several LRC students becoming researchers in Europe for a year during the 1970s or 1980s (e.g. Sheri Fritz, Cathy Whitlock, Eric Grimm, Jim Clark, Brian Cumming, Heather Almquist, George Jacobson).\nLake Zeribar was visited again in 1970 by Herb along with Red Watson, Dick Wright, Krystyna Wasylikowa, and Kazimierz Wasylik (the latter two has also been visitors to the pollen lab). This expedition raised 40 m of sediment that extended to 48,000 years ago and provided a very detailed pollen stratigraphy (van Zeist & Bottema 1977; van Zeist 2008a, 2008b). Many palaeoecological analyses involving diatoms, macrofossils, Characeae, molluscs, ostracods, and stable-isotopes as well as pollen were done on the Zeribar cores, and all this multi-disciplinary work has been brought together by Krystyna Wasylikowa and Andrzej Witkowski in a monograph about Lake Zeribar dedicated to Herb (Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008).\nFinding sites suitable for pollen analysis in the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean is not easy and Willem van Zeist, Herb, and others had many field adventures together in Iran, Israel, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Greece searching for promising sites. Perhaps the most notable adventure was when Herb who was driving a land-rover with a wide, ready-assembled coring raft on the roof-rack tried to drive along a road in a Greek village that was narrower than the coring raft and demolished a balcony off the side of a house!\nThe next two European visitors to the pollen lab both came in late 1961 and early 1962. William (‘Bill’) Watts (1930–2010) from Ireland came for a year in late December 1961 with his wife Gerry and their two young boys Niall and Michael (Watts 2008). C Roel Janssen (1930–2015) came with his wife Nini early in 1962 and stayed for just over two years. Both Bill and Roel contributed greatly to the laboratory and the international camaraderie that was developing in Herb’s group. They returned many times to Minnesota: Bill worked with Herb for nearly 40 years and Roel worked with Herb for over 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Watts\nRoel Janssen\n\n\n\nRoel’s doctoral thesis was on the Holocene vegetational history of the Limburg area in the south-eastern Netherlands (Janssen 1960). By studying basins of different sizes, Roel became aware of the differences in pollen assemblages from small and medium-sized basins and began to formulate his ideas about local, extra-local, regional, and extra-regional pollen deposition. His first scientific paper (Janssen 1959) was on ‘Alnus as a disturbing factor in pollen diagrams’ and Roel suggested that different pollen calculation sums were appropriate for different types and sizes of sites. By coincidence, Herb and his student Harvey Patten were thinking about a related problem – the massive local over-representation of pollen of prairie draw-down plants in the Chenopodiaceae at Lake Carlson (Wright & Patten 1963). When Herb discussed with Roel the idea of Roel coming to Minnesota, Roel enthusiastically told Herb all about Alnus, local pollen deposition, etc. whilst Herb just listened. After an hour, Herb said ‘when are you coming to Minnesota?’.\nAs recounted in the biography of Herb, Roel and Herb had both been involved in Operations Manna and Chowhound (van der Zee 1978) during the ‘Hongervinter’ (hunger winter) of 1944–45 in The Netherlands. Herb was then a Major in the 95th Bombardment Group of the Army Air Corps. He made vital air-drops of sacks of food urgently needed by the starving Dutch into marked fields during Operations Manna and Chowhound. Roel was a young Dutch boy from near Arnhem, who collected some of the sacks dropped by Herb’s squadron.\nRoel primarily worked in Minnesota on modern deposition along vegetational transects to assess local, extra-local, and regional pollen deposition (Janssen 1966, 1967a, 1967b, 1973, 1984). He also analysed in considerable taxonomic and stratigraphical detail the pollen stratigraphy of Stevens Pond, a small Typha swamp in north-western Minnesota (Janssen 1967c) near where Jock McAndrews (1966) had studied regional pollen stratigraphies from medium-sized lakes. He also worked (Janssen 1968) on the vegetational history of Myrtle Lake, a lake within the vast Myrtle Lake peatland complex of northern Minnesota and a site infamous for an unsuccessful but very adventurous coring trip in 1970. Besides work in Minnesota, Roel was very active with his Utrecht students studying vegetational history of the Vosges Mountains and the Forez in France and of the Serra da Estrêla in western Portugal.\nBill Watts came first to Minnesota at Herb’s invitation to develop quantitative stratigraphic plant-macrofossil analysis on one of the lab’s pioneering palynological studies at Kirchner Marsh (Winter 1962; Wright et al. 1963). Bill produced one of the first ever quantitative plant-macrofossil studies (Watts & Winter 1966). Bill made similar detailed studies in northern Minnesota (Wright & Watts 1969), South Dakota (Watts & Bright 1968), and the Nebraska Sand Hills (Watts & Wright 1966). He also provided the first synthesis of late-glacial plant-macrofossil studies in Minnesota (Watts 1967).\nBill’s main interest in working in the USA came from his previous work on Irish Tertiary floras and his fascination with historical plant geography and questions of tree survival in glacial stages. At the end of his first Minnesotan visit, Bill and Jock McAndrews visited Mud Lake, north-central Florida and after various coring adventures, they raised a 1360 cm sediment sequence that extended into the last interglacial (Sangamon) and the previous Illinoian glacial or even earlier (Watts 1969). Bill then devoted much of his research time (he was also very active in teaching and administration at Trinity College Dublin, being its Provost 1981–91 and chair of various leading Irish conservation and hospital boards (Watts 2008)) to the vegetational history of the south-eastern states, especially Georgia and Florida (Watts 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1980, 1983; Watts & Stuiver 1980; Watts et al. 1992; Grimm et al. 1993; Watts & Hansen 1994; Hansen et al. 2001), central Appalachia and the New Jersey coastal plain (Watts 1979), and Mexico (Watts & Bradbury 1982).\nOne of Herb’s MSc students Richard (‘Dick’) Baker who had started working on the pollen stratigraphy at Spider Creek, a late-glacial site north-west of Duluth, took up plant-macrofossil analysis under Bill’s tutelage (Baker 1965). Dick went on to make important plant-macrofossil studies in the mid-West (Baker et al. 1989, 1996, 2002, 2009) and Yellowstone (Baker 1976). Bob Bright, a former doctoral student of Herb’s also took up plant-macrofossil analysis and produced detailed Holocene pollen and macrofossil stratigraphies from Swan Lake in south-east Idaho (Bright 1966). Bill Watts influenced other people in macrofossils, including Hilary Birks in 1970 (Birks 2016) and Cathy Whitlock (Barnosky 1984, 1985a, 1985b).\nThe pollen lab was greatly strengthened by Barbara Hansen joining it in 1961 after completing her MSc in the Botany Department. She worked with Herb, Ed, Bill Watts, and other colleagues on a very wide range of palynological projects on several continents (John Birks 2016). She became one of the most versatile and experienced palynologists in the US. She was honoured in 2001 by being awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota.\n\n\n\nEarly days of the LRC, about 1962, with Barbara Hansen, Bob Megard, ?Anne McKnight, and Ed Cushing in Room 213 of Pillsbury Hall\n\n\nBy the time the next European palaeoecologist (Kerstin Griffin) came in 1963 to work with Herb, the pollen lab was now part of the Limnological Research Center (LRC). The LRC was quickly expanding its research activities into neolimnology with faculty members Joe Shapiro, Alan Brook, Bob Megard, and Eville Gorham and soon into palaeolimnology with the import of experienced European diatomists such as Maj-Britt Florin in 1964, Kazik Wasylik in 1965, and Elizabeth Haworth in 1966.\nAs the pollen lab and its collections continued to expand, a manager was appointed in 1965. Jean Waddington from England ran the lab very efficiently and completed various projects with Herb, Ed, Platt Bradbury, and others (e.g. Bradbury & Waddington 1973; Waddington & Wright 1974). She did a MSc with Ed on the pollen stratigraphy of a lake in the Big Woods of Minnesota (Waddington 1969). She left the LRC in 1974 and her place as lab manager was taken by Linda Shane. Linda obtained her PhD from Kent State University (Shane 1976, 1987, 1989). She ran the lab excellently until 2002 when she became Manager of the LRC Lacustrine Core Laboratory (LacCore). She also edited with Ed Cushing the wide-ranging symposium volume Quaternary Landscapes (Shane and Cushing 1991) to honour Herb on the occasion of his formal retirement from the University of Minnesota in 1988. He did not actually retire from field work until about 2007 and from science, scientific writing and editing until about 2014.\nKerstin Griffin came from Oslo in 1963 and worked in the LRC from 1963 to 1968. She was the first international PhD student to work in the LRC and she was awarded her University of Minnesota PhD in 1973 based on her thesis on Paleoecological aspects of Red Lake Peatland (Griffin 1975, 1977). Kerstin’s work on the palaeoecology and development of the Red Lake peatland, a vast patterned fen with complex surface patterns (Wright et al. 1992), was one of the first studies that Herb and his LRC colleagues made on the patterned peatlands of Minnesota and elsewhere in North America and Scandinavia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerstin Griffin\nMaj-Britt Florin\n\n\n\nThe next long-term visitor to the LRC was also Scandinavian – Maj-Britt Florin (1905–1993) – who worked with Herb in 1964–65. She came from Uppsala in Sweden to work on late-glacial diatom assemblages in the lowermost sediments including the basal ‘trash layer’. Maj-Britt was part of the strong Swedish tradition in the LRC that started with Magnus Fries and was continued by Svante Björck (1981–82 and later) and Ingemar Renberg (1991). The LRC was, as always, short of good microscopes and Herb in his invitation to Maj-Britt to come and work in the LRC asked her to bring her own microscope! Maj-Britt was one of the world’s leading diatomists and did important work on diatoms in relation to sea-level changes in eastern Sweden as well as detailed pollen analytical studies (Hasle & Miller 1994). Maj-Britt was one of the young students on the famous 1933 Baltic Course on pollen analysis taught by Lennart von Post (Fægri 1981). At this course she met other young Scandinavian palaeoecologists who went on to be major figures in pollen analysis and palaeoecology, notably Knut Fægri and Johs Iversen. Maj-Britt’s work in Minnesota (Florin & Wright 1969, Florin 1970) was on the late-glacial diatoms at Kirchner Marsh. She showed that the basal ‘trash layer’ containing wood and other terrestrial coarse plant material and diatoms of soil, moss, and shallow ponds, represented the ground-layer of a spruce forest growing on buried ice. In light of these findings as well as work by one of Herb’s geology graduates, Vern Rampton (LRC 1964–69) in the St Elias Mountains in the Yukon Territory (Rampton 1970, 1971, 1978), Herb planned a multi-disciplinary study in 1971 on the Klutlan Glacier in the Yukon to examine and study modern analogues for ice-cored areas in late-glacial Minnesota (Wright 1980).\nThe next European visitors, Krystyna Wasylikowa and her husband Kazimierz (‘Kazik’) Wasylik (1925–2000) came from Kraków in Poland in 1964 and 1965 (Kazik). Krystyna’s expertise is in plant macrofossils whereas Kazik was a diatomist. Krystyna recalls (pers. comm. 2015) “My first meeting with Herb is still very vivid in my memory. It was in 1961 during the INQUA Congress in Warsaw. I presented a paper about an interesting site where Bølling and Allerød peats were separated by a dune sand. After the session a man came to me and said (or rather mumbled) ‘I am Professor Wright from Minnesota, would you like to come to us with your husband to work at the university?’ And so it started. Our wonderful time in Minnesota, the travel to Iran (with Dick Wright), work on the Zeribar cores, and Herb’s several travels to Poland. He was quite a personality. I think I can say that we were friends in spite of the distance and our rare meetings.” Krystyna worked on the plant macrofossils in the various cores from Lake Zeribar and Kazik worked on the diatoms (Wasylikowa 1967, 2008; Wasylikowa et al. 2006, 2008; Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008; Witkowski et al. 2008). She also worked on late-glacial pollen and macrofossils at Blackhoof, a late-glacial site in north-eastern Minnesota (Wasylikowa & Wright 1970).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrystyna Wasylikowa\nKazik Wasylik\n\n\n\nThe diatom tradition started by Maj-Britt and Kazik was continued by the next LRC visitor, Elizabeth (‘Liz’) Haworth from the Freshwater Biological Association at Ambleside in the English Lake District. Liz worked in the LRC, mainly with Bob Bright during 1966–67. Liz extended the palaeoecological study of Watts and Bright (1968) at Pickerel Lake, South Dakota that involved pollen, molluscs, and plant macrofossils. Liz made a detailed diagram stratigraphy that showed major changes in diatom composition with brackish-water diatoms occurring during the mid-Holocene period of prairie expansion and increased regional aridity (Haworth 1972).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiz Haworth\nJohanna Grüger\nEberhard Grüger\n\n\n\nJohanna Grüger (LRC 1967–69) and her husband Eberhard Grüger (LRC 1968–69) came from Hans-Jürgen Beug’s laboratory in Göttingen to work with Herb on potentially old sediments from Kansas (Johanna) and Illinois (Eberhard) (Grüger E 1972a, 1972b; Grüger J 1973). They came as post-doctoral fellows and both did combined detailed pollen and plant macrofossil studies on sequences extending as far back as the late Illinoian stage prior to the Sangamonian (last) interglacial. Johanna had previously worked in the Lake Garda area of the southern Alps (Grüger J 1968) and Eberhard had worked on Lower Pleistocene (Cromerian complex) sequences in central Germany (Grüger E 1968). Johanna also used her southern European palynological experience whilst in the LRC to analyse some sediment samples from Lake Voulkaria, north-western Greece collected by Herb in 1966 and 1967 as part of the Minnesota Messenia Expedition that aimed to reconstruct the Bronze Age environment of Messenia (Wright 1972; Wright & Grüger 2010).\n1969 was the first year since the pollen laboratory and LRC were founded when there was no ‘resident’ European palaeoecologist working in Room 218 in Pillsbury Hall. Bill Watts made one short visit, but otherwise the LRC expanded in 1968–69 with three North American post-doctoral researchers (Mel Whiteside, David P Adam, J Platt Bradbury) and several PhD students (among others Al Swain, Paul Glaser, Chris Synerholm) and MSc (among others Alan Craig, Gail Garrison, Donna Amundson). Alan Craig was the first international MSc student to work with Herb in the LRC. Alan came from Trinity College Dublin where he had been taught botany and palaeoecology by Bill Watts. Alan, as part of his TCD BA, had done a pollen study of two sites in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia (Craig 1969). For his Minnesota MSc, Alan produced a complete Holocene pollen stratigraphy from the annually-laminated sediments of Lake of the Clouds in north-east Minnesota (Craig 1972), a site that Herb and his friend Miron Heinselman had discovered in their quest to derive long-term fire histories using charcoal preserved in lake sediments. Alan then returned to Dublin where he did his PhD on late-glacial vegetation history of south-east Ireland (Craig 1978). He then moved into nature conservation in Ireland and worked for the National Parks and Monuments branch of the Office of Public Works. He helped Bill Watts (Watts 2008) to persuade the Office of Public Works to create the Glenveagh, Connemara, and Burren National Parks. Hilary and John Birks worked as post-doctoral fellows in the LRC in 1970 and, in John’s case, later on shorter visits up to 1982. By 1970 the days of European palaeoecological pioneers were largely over and the LRC expanded its research in aquatic ecology, neolimnology, and palaeoecology with many post-doctoral fellows and PhD and MSc students and a few European visitors such as Rick Battarbee (UK, 1981–82), Svante Björck (Sweden, 1981–82), and Ingemar Renberg (Sweden, 1991). Bill Watts and Roel Janssen continued to visit the LRC for short periods. Short-term (1–2 months or one semester) palaeoecological foreign visitors included RG West (UK, 1960), Jan Mangerud (Norway, 1972), Norio Fuji (Japan, 1975), and Kevin Edwards (UK, 1983).\nOn reflection, Herb’s policy of inviting European palaeoecological pioneers was a brilliant idea. It was highly successful, not only in the ground-breaking research the ‘pioneers’ did, but also in the stimulation, expertise, friendships, and skills that they brought and contributed to the development of the pollen laboratory and later the LRC through its many graduate students and researchers, many of whom have gone to become leading palaeoecologists. It was a most effective and productive policy and one which the European pioneers greatly enjoyed. All benefitted intellectually and socially from their Minnesotan years as well as learning much about field-craft with Herb!\n\n\nPhoto credits: Magnus Fries, courtesy of Björn E Berglund; Ed Cushing, courtesy of University of Minnesota; Jock McAndrews courtesy of Royal Ontario Museum and University of Toronto; Tom Winter, Lou Maher, and Bob Bright , courtesy of Jim Almendinger; Saskia Jelgersma, courtesy of Wim Westerhoff & Sytze van Heteren; Bill Watts by Fraser Mitchell; Roel Janssen by John Birks; LRC lab, courtesy of Bob Megard and Paul Glaser; Kerstin Griffin, courtesy of Lisbeth Prosch-Danielsen; Maj-Britt Florin by Maja Florin; Krystyna Wasylikowa by Adam Walanus; Kazik Wasylik, courtesy of Jim Almendinger; Liz Haworth, courtesy of Fritsch Algal Collection; Johanna Grüger by Eberhard Grüger; Eberhard Grüger, courtesy of Thomas Giesecke.\nI am indebted to many of the European pioneers for sharing their experiences with me, to Bill Watts for encouraging Hilary and me to go to Minnesota in 1970, to Emi Ito for information, and to Cathy Jenks for her care in preparing the text.\n\n\n\nBaker RG.

    "text": "by John Birks\n\n\nHerb Wright (1917–2015) was one of the world’s most distinguished Quaternary scientists. He was a great scientific polymath and an intellectual giant within the broad field of Quaternary research. He had an immense impact on many aspects of Quaternary science during the second half of the 20th century. He contributed greatly to our understanding of landscape history and environmental changes over the past 100,000 years in many parts of the world. He started with arid-region geomorphology and landscape evolution, which naturally shifted when he moved to Minnesota to glacial geology and climate history. The study of these topics led him to the study of vegetation development and environmental history and allowed him to define the timing and mechanisms of climate-driven vegetational shifts in North America during the last 18,000 years and to recognise the role of natural fire in the dynamics of northern forests. He was able to apply effectively these insights on fire history to wilderness conservation and landscape management. His endless curiosity expanded to cover many other aspects of palaeoecology including lake development and palaeolimnology, and the history and development of the vast patterned peatlands of the Northern Hemisphere. His work was concentrated in Minnesota, with its complex glacial, landscape, vegetational, and climatic history, but his broader vision led him to be involved in a major synthesis of global palaeoclimatology. Beyond Minnesota and the Great Lakes region, Herb studied a wide range of research questions elsewhere in North America, and in the Near East, Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Antarctica. His multidisciplinary approach and great powers of synthesis uncovered how the Earth’s landscapes and biota have been transformed at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in the past through the interactions between climate, flora, fauna, landform, and human activity.\nHerb, who died peacefully at his home in St Paul, Minnesota after a long illness on 12 November 2015, was born in Malden, Massachusetts on 13 September 1917. He studied at Harvard University, including his PhD on arid-region geomorphology and landscape evolution in New Mexico under the supervision of Kirk Bryan Sr. He completed his PhD thesis in 1943 whilst also training to be a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot during 1942–43. He flew many missions over Europe in 1944 and early 1945. In late 1945 he was appointed a teaching assistant at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island and moved in 1947 to be an assistant professor in the Department of Geology, University of Minnesota. He remained there for over 60 years and continually broadened his research interests and experiences and areas of study. He was appointed full professor in geology in 1959 and Regents’ Professor of Geology, Ecology, and Botany in 1974. The Limnological Research Center (LRC) was founded in 1959 and Herb was its director from 1963–90. The LRC quickly became the leading North American centre and power-house for palaeoecological, palaeolimnological, and neolimnological research. He always realised the importance of international communication and collaboration so a key policy of the LRC was to attract a large number of overseas visitors who provided inspiration, allowed a cross-fertilisation of ideas, and introduced multidisciplinary approaches to the LRC and its students. Between 1963 and 1990, visitors had come from at least 18 countries. During his long academic career, Herb supervised over 75 graduate and doctoral students, mentored countless other students, post-doctoral researchers, and research visitors from around the world, and influenced the careers of a very large number of students, friends, and colleagues. Very many are now leading scholars and making outstanding contributions to many different aspects of Quaternary research. Between 1943 and 2014, Herb published over 200 papers or monographs, and edited 15 influential books and six Special Issues of journals on a very wide range of topics within Quaternary science.\nThe major underlying theme of Herb’s scientific activities was the reconstruction of late-Quaternary landscape history at various spatial and temporal scales to explain the functioning of our present landscapes and ecosystems and how they might respond to climate change and human impact in the future. Thus he synthesised the vegetational and climatic history of Minnesota and adjacent states using a range of geological and palaeoecological approaches. With Miron ‘Bud’ Heinselman and others, Herb unravelled the key role of natural fire in the dynamics of coniferous forests. This led to Bud, Herb, and others to mount a successful campaign to save an extensive area of unlogged old-growth forest in northernmost Minnesota. Herb made major contributions to the understanding of the complex glacial history of the Great Lakes region and the control of the landscape on the development of peatlands and the origin of their spectacular surface patterns in the extensive peatlands of northern Minnesota and also in Labrador, Ireland, central Sweden, and northern Norway. He co-directed the multi-institutional Co-operative Holocene Mapping Project (COHMAP) with John Kutzbach, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein, and others in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In COHMAP, past climates were simulated by a global circulation model at 3000 year intervals for the last 18,000 years. Most importantly, attempts were made to validate the model simulation results against actual palaeoclimatic data. COHMAP resulted in a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research.\nAnother of Herb’s major contributions was the development of geo-archaeology starting in Lebanon and proceeding to Iraq, Iran, Kurdistan, and Turkey, and subsequently to Greece, Labrador, Peru, and Bolivia to study how the landscape and environment influenced the development of human societies and land-use practices.\nHerb was one of the first American scientists to realise that understanding environmental history required continuous sedimentary archives extending back in time: the most informative being lake sediments. A major but often unrealised contribution was Herb’s perfection of techniques for coring lake-sediments. This contribution has enabled the vast majority of palaeolimnological and palaeoecological research today. He had a passion for fieldwork and sediment coring, seeming to enjoy it most under difficult or near impossible winter conditions in Minnesota and the Dakotas, in wilderness areas such as Labrador, Alaska, and the Yukon, and in physically demanding regions such as the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes and the Siberian Altai. He loved fieldwork and he was coring lake sediments in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria just before his 90th birthday.\nHerb’s distinguished career was recognised by many honours and awards including honorary doctorates from Trinity College Dublin, Lund University, and University of Minnesota, membership of the National Academy of Sciences, a Distinguished Career Award from the American Quaternary Association, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Paleolimnological Association.\n\n\n\nThis biography attempts to describe and document the major contributions of Herb to Quaternary science and to outline his early life and education, career, family life, and retirement, as well as his influence on many students, colleagues, and friends. Before discussing Herb’s early life and his wide-ranging academic activities over 70 years, I summarise what to me are Herb’s ten most important contributions to Quaternary science. I discuss them in greater detail as separate topics within the large section on his ‘Scientific research activities and their impact’, before I conclude with a discussion of Herb’s lasting legacies and some personal comments.\nHerb had many research interests and made major contributions to a wide range of topics. His scientific contributions include the following.\n\nDeveloping geo-archaeological studies in the Near East (Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Kurdistan) and presenting important and challenging hypotheses linking early domestication and cultural events with climate change. In contrast to the long-standing hypothesis of environmental determinism in cultural history presented by Gordon Childe in the 1920s, Wright’s hypotheses were based on the results of detailed palaeoecological studies which he had initiated and which showed that climate in south-western Asia changed from dry to moist in the earliest Holocene. Childe had assumed the opposite, namely a moist-temperate period in the glacial period had changed to the semi-arid climate of today, thereby forcing animals, plants, and humans to congregate at oases where domestication had begun. Herb maintained a keen and active interest in multidisciplinary archaeological projects and worked on such projects later in, for example, southern Greece, Labrador, Peru, and Bolivia. These geo-archaeological studies ranging over 50 years of Herb’ s scientific career showed how the landscape and environment influenced, in different ways and in different settings, human development and societies.\nDeciphering the complex glacial history and resulting geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent states with their multiple ice-lakes, glacial surges, tunnel valleys, pro-glacial lakes and their shorelines, and ice-advances and ice-retreats. Herb also worked on many aspects of glacial geomorphology and landscape evolution elsewhere in areas as diverse as Alaska, the Yukon Territory, the Rockies, New Mexico, the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia, northern Greenland, Siberian Altai, the Near East, and Antarctica.\nSynthesising the late-Quaternary vegetation and climate history of Minnesota and adjacent states primarily based on the results of detailed pollen-analytical and plant-macrofossil studies. He also facilitated innovative studies on the vegetational and environmental history of Labrador, the Yukon Territory, Alaska, the south-eastern United States, New Mexico, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Iran, and Siberian Altai. He had a great passion for fieldwork and sediment coring (see 8 below).\nCreating a centre (the LRC) for North American palaeolimnology and neolimnology where critical questions on recent and prehistoric impact on lake ecosystems, past lake-levels, hydrological changes, patterns of lake ontogeny in recently deglaciated areas, and long-term lake development were studied intensively.\nCo-directing the multi-institutional COHMAP research consortium with John Kutzbach, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein, and others. The basic idea was to simulate past climates at 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, and 0 ka and to compare the climate-model simulations with available palaeoclimatic data. COHMAP led to a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research and Herb was a key contributor to this.\nUnderstanding the origin and maintenance of the spectacular surface patterns of northern Minnesotan peatlands, and subsequently, of patterned peatlands in Labrador, Ireland, central Sweden, and northern Norway.\nRecognising with Bud Heinselman the essential role of natural fires in determining the composition, structure, and dynamics of northern Minnesotan coniferous forests. Herb and colleagues pioneered the detailed reconstruction of Holocene fire histories from charcoal fragments preserved in annually laminated lake sediments. This early work showed the importance of fire in coniferous forest dynamics and had major implications for forest management and fire-suppression policies. Herb’s synthesis of landscape development, forest fires, and management was one of the earliest studies where palaeoecological results were used to propose management and conservation policies. Bud, Herb, and others campaigned tirelessly in the 1970s to save an extensive area of virgin, unlogged old-growth forest in northernmost Minnesota as a wilderness area where snow-mobiles, outboard motors, and logging would be prohibited. They succeeded in 1978 when President Jimmy Carter signed the relevant legislative bill.\nPerfecting field-craft and lake-sediment coring. Herb was as much at home in the field, even under difficult or sometimes atrocious conditions as he was in his departmental office or in his St. Paul home. He had a passion for coring sediments in lakes and he perfected coring from open-water using a variety of boats, canoes, home-made rafts, fallen logs, and even truck-tyre inner-tubes as platforms to core from. He continually improved lightweight piston corers and drive rods. Fieldwork with Herb could often turn into an adventure, or a serious adventure, or even a struggle to survive! He claimed never to remember any of these adventures, misadventures, or struggles! He loved all types of fieldwork, particularly in wild and remote areas.\nWriting clearly and concisely and editing manuscripts were two of Herb’s many skills and contributions to science. His publications are models of simple, concise, and elegant scientific writing. Herb commented after his 80th birthday that he must enjoy editing and thought that perhaps it went back to his days editing his high-school newsletter in the early 1930s.\nNetworking and international collaboration were an important part of Herb’s scientific modus operandi. Soon after World War II, Herb travelled widely in Europe and by the time he established the Pollen Laboratory in Minnesota in 1958, he had visited all the main European pollen laboratories and met the leading palynologists of the time. The LRC was a hotspot of international activity and collaboration in the 1960s–1980s thanks to Herb’s networking and collaborative skills. After his retirement, he continued to be a regular visitor to Europe to visit laboratories and friends, explore new landscapes, attend field excursions, and, of course, to help core sediments in lakes and mires in, for example, Norway, Ireland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Georgia, Siberian Altai, and on the Azores and Madeira, as well as in Kenya, Bolivia, Peru, and Alaska.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerbert (‘Herb’) Edgar Wright Jr was born on 13 September 1917 in Malden, Massachusetts. His father, Herbert Edgar Wright Sr was an osteopath who died during the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1919–20. His mother, Annie Mabel Richardson (1878–1964), was a nurse. Herb had an elder sister, Helena (1915–2010). As a child Herb spent much time in the western suburbs of Boston with his favourite uncles and their families. He attended high school in Malden, where he enjoyed playing basketball and football. A high-school essay written on 14 November 1932 by the 15-year-old Herb on “Thoughts and Achievements” in College English 3 survives and provides details about Herb’s early life, and his thoughts, achievements, and ambitions. Herb’s father had been taught the clarinet by his brother-in-law and Herb Sr travelled around the eastern USA with a jazz band. He subsequently took up the new subject of osteopathy and he practiced his clarinet in the day and went to night-school in the evenings. Herb Jr records that he was a most active boy when young and had to be strapped into bed until he went to sleep. He started school when he was six and Herb wrote “I did not dislike school. I always took an interest in and tried to get all I could out of it”. He supplemented his meagre pocket money by cutting grass, selling papers, delivering and selling doughnuts made by his mother to some of his paper-round customers on Saturday mornings, and singing in local choirs. By 1932 Herb had saved enough to pay for a year at college. He was clearly a meticulous notekeeper, as he kept records of his finances, books read, movies, plays, lectures, etc. attended, marks received at school, and so on. In the concluding outlook in his essay, Herb wrote “If finances and other difficulties permit, I will continue to college, one of the best, I hope, and study as exclusively as I can in some subject that interests me. … Whenever I hear anyone speak about history from the fall of Rome to 1700, I am immediately interested. Why, I don’t know. Whenever anyone speaks of the creation of the world, or of ancient man before the first signs of cultivation, or of psychology, I am enthusiastic. Maybe I shall be a doctor or a college professor, for these two professions interest me a little, but whatever my occupation may be, it will take plenty of study and hard work. I am determined to go through college, though I haven’t planned on any certain one yet, although Harvard, Dartmouth, and West Point interest me. The selection, however, is not for me to decide now. I must wait until I finish my present course before I look too far ahead.”\nThe 15-year-old Herb’s ambition of studying at Harvard came to fruition as he graduated with a BA magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1939 and received his MA and PhD in geology from Harvard University in 1941 and 1943, respectively. His other ambition of becoming a college professor materialised in 1947. Herb started out as a Harvard biology student, with some thoughts of reading history or biology, following the footsteps of his sister who majored in biology at Radcliffe College, but after a trip to all the national parks west of the Mississippi River with their spectacular landscape, Herb’s interests shifted to geology, in particular arid-region geomorphology, landscapes, and their patterns and evolution (Herb Wright, pers. comm. 1971). He was greatly encouraged by Kirk Bryan Sr, a person who also greatly influenced the interests and careers of many students and colleagues. During his years at Harvard, Herb was Austin Teaching Fellow, laboratory assistant to Kirtley Mather, and field instructor for Kirk Bryan Sr (Schwartz 1972). He also helped to pay for his Harvard education by cutting grass, by driving tourists around downtown Boston, by working as a parking-lot attendant, by waiting at the student lunch club, and by other jobs at 50c an hour.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright in the 95th Bombardment Group of the Army Air Corps in 1944 (photo supplied by Jim Almendinger)\n\n\nWhen America entered World War II, Herb enlisted in 1942 as an air-cadet and became a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps. He finished writing his PhD thesis in boot camp in Nashville and whilst he was being trained to fly B-17 bombers at Geiger Field and Ephrata Air Bases, Washington, Rapid City Army Air Base, South Dakota, and Pyote, west Texas. He made two tours of combat duty based in Britain and flew 48 missions in 1944–1945 including runs over Germany during D-Day, over Berlin after D-Day, and at the Battle of the Bulge (Wright, unpublished note ‘1944 England’). He served as a pilot, command pilot, and group operations officer, reaching the rank of major (Schwartz 1972). He belonged to the 95th Bombardment Group stationed at RAF Horham near Bury St Edmonds in East Anglia. The 95th Group was the only Eighth Air Force group awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations and had the highest total claims of enemy aircraft (425) destroyed (Morris & Hawkins 2012). He was awarded the Air Medal six times, the Distinguished Flying Cross twice, and the Croix de Guerre from Charles de Gaulle. During his spare time at Horham, Herb visited by bicycle several classical Quaternary sites in the area including the famous interglacial site at Hoxne where he found Palaeolithic implements and Diss Mere, a lake that he was to revisit to core in 1979.\nWhen he was on leave and away from Horham for a few days, Herb often visited London with fellow airmen. There he attended concerts (e.g. Bach Mass in B Minor, Elgar The Dream of Gerontius), ballet, and plays; bought vinyl LPs of Beethoven’s piano concertos; ate and drank whisky and brandy at the Savoy Hotel; was fascinated by the soap-box orators at Hyde Park Corner; and spent exciting days in the library of the Geology Museum in Kensington where he lunched with its director. He also visited Oxford and Cambridge, learnt to play golf and bridge, and enjoyed English and French cuisine. His Quaternary field excursions, concerts in London, and visits to the Geology Museum are not listed in the official ‘Instructions for American Servicemen in Britain’ (War and Navy Departments 1942) which provides advice on the peculiarities of the “British, their country, and their ways” in an attempt to “lesson the culture shock for those embarking on their first trip to Great Britain and, for the most part, abroad”. Herb did not seem to suffer from any cultural shock whilst stationed in England!\nHerb considered his most exciting war-time moment came after his flight training when he was given a four-engine B-17 Flying Fortress nicknamed Lizzie to fly from Goose Bay in Labrador to England with a crew of 10 in the winter of early 1944. One engine had low oil pressure before taking off but Herb was allowed to set off across the Atlantic. Another engine failed halfway across the Atlantic. The plane began to lose power and altitude towards the Irish coast and Herb was forced to make an emergency landing at St Angelo airfield on the shores of Lough Erne near Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh. He landed too fast owing to ice that had accumulated on the wings and ran off the runway, coming to an abrupt halt with Lizzie’s right landing-gear intact but buried in mud and peat up to the top of the wheel and the left landing-gear buried up to the hub. The ball target, nose glass, and fixtures were damaged and three of Lizzie’s propellers were bent. Fortunately no-one was hurt but Herb confessed that he “felt a bit stupid after landing” (transcript of Wright’s crash report). He remarked later that to his amazement he simply signed a chit and was given a new plane (Paul Glazer, pers. comm. 2015). He also said that his landing at St Angelo may have been his first walk on a bog, many of which he visited professionally in years to come (George Jacobson, pers. comm. 2016).\nIn May 1945, Herb flew important aid-drops to The Netherlands. Sacks containing potatoes, flour, chocolate, etc. were dropped into marked fields bordered by cheering local residents. One young Dutch boy from near Arnhem collected some of the sacks – his name was C Roel Janssen (1930–2015) (Janssen, pers. comm. 2014). Janssen became a palynologist with a major research group in Utrecht, and worked with Herb in Minnesota 1962-1964 and later on short visits up to 1990.\nAfter his European tours flying B-17s, Herb returned to the USA and volunteered to fly in the Pacific theatre of war. He was sent to Sioux Falls Army Airfield, South Dakota for training with the new B-29s. In his spare time he borrowed a bicycle and explored the interesting Dakotan landscape. The 95th Bombardment Group was inactivated on 28 August 1945. Herb commented many years later that his favourite times flying were when he just had to put in hours in the air (for his pilot certification) because on those flights he could enjoy the clouds and the geomorphology of the landscapes beneath (George Jacobson, pers. comm. 2016).\nHerb’s first scientific paper (Wright 1943) was on the petrology, formation, and age of Cerro Colorado, an isolated non-basaltic volcano in central New Mexico. This was his first introduction to the geology and geomorphology of semi-arid landscapes. He continued in such landscapes for his PhD, which was on the Tertiary and Quaternary geology and geomorphology of the arid Lower Rio Puerco valley in western New Mexico (Wright 1946). It was during this work that he developed his strong and ever-lasting fascination with landscape history rather than only bedrock geology and geomorphological processes. He quickly realised, however, that landscape history could not be quantified without a chronology, and he puzzled about how to obtain such a chronology. He rapidly recognised the potential of lakes as they contained organic material that might be suitable not only for palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental investigations such as pollen analysis but also, perhaps in the future, for some form of relative or absolute dating. Herb continued this fascination and interest in the study of lakes and their sediments for over 60 years.\nHis PhD advisor and influential mentor, Kirk Bryan Sr (1888–1950), made a major impact on Herb’s career and research interests (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Herb acknowledges Kirk Bryan Sr (Wright 1946) for planning and guiding his Lower Rio Puerco study and gracefully suggests that “many of the ideas herewith presented were inspired by discussions with him”. Bryan was interested in many aspects of environmental history, especially climate change (Whittlesey 1951). His graduate students translated current papers by German scientists who were reconstructing ice-age conditions in Europe. In his early career as a faculty member at the University of Minnesota, Herb continued this tradition and distributed to colleagues translations of papers by, for example, Hans Poser (1907-1998), Julius Büdel (1903-1983) (Wright 1959; Wright & Alt 1959), and Carl Troll (1899-1975) (Wright 1958), mainly about the periglacial record in central Europe and periglacial processes globally. After visiting Europe in the late 1940s and meeting leading Quaternary scientists and geomorphologists in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Herb published a large review paper on the Late Pleistocene climate of Europe (Wright 1961a). Kirk Bryan was also interested in European vegetational and climatic history and late-glacial chronology and in the linkage between archaeology and geology. Both interests were keenly followed by Herb during his own research career. Another Kirk Bryan tradition that Herb followed was to hold weekly seminars in his home. For over 50 years, Herb held Wednesday-evening seminars on Quaternary glacial geology, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology, palaeolimnology, and neolimnology in the Wright home in St Anthony Park, St Paul McAndrews 2016). The seminars continue to this day in the same house, now hosted by Vania Stefanova.\nWhen Herb was appointed Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Minnesota in September 1947, he had already developed interests in lakes and their sediments, in geological applications to archaeology through his 1947 study near Beirut (see below), in landscape history, and in European vegetational and climatic history; interests that he would develop extensively during his long and distinguished academic career.\n\n\n\nAfter his war service in the Army Air Corps, Herb Wright was appointed in 1945 to be a teaching instructor at Brown College (now Brown University) (Providence, Rhode Island), then a liberal-arts college. He moved to the University of Minnesota in September 1947 as an Assistant Professor in the then Department of Geology (in 1962 it became the Department of Geology and Geophysics and is now the Department of Earth Sciences). The search procedure for this faculty position in 1947 consisted of a short informal interview with George A Thiel (1892-1979), the Chair of the Department. Thiel was attending a Geological Society of America meeting in New York. He telephoned Herb and asked him to take the train from Providence to New York so that they could meet. The ‘interview’ was in the lobby of Thiel’s hotel. At the end of their meeting, Thiel told Herb that he was hired – quite a contrast to today’s procedures of search committees, evaluation boards, trial lectures, counting publication citations, h-indices, etc. Once installed in Pillsbury Hall where the University of Minnesota’s Department of Geology is housed, Herb remained there for over 60 years. He was promoted to Associate Professor of Geology in 1951 and to Professor of Geology in 1959. He was also appointed Professor of Botany in 1965 and in Ecology in 1970 within the newly-formed Department of Ecology and Evolution and Behavioral Biology (now Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) at the University of Minnesota. He was named Regents’ Professor of Geology, Ecology, and Botany in 1974 and became Regents’ Professor Emeritus in 1988.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright, 1959 (photo supplied by Jim Almendinger)\n\n\nHerb had a large teaching load (Schwartz 1972) with courses or seminar series on structural geology, stratigraphy, and glaciology, as well as on his research interests such as physical geology and geomorphology, glacial geology, Quaternary environmental change, and landscape and climate history. He lectured to thousands and advised more than 75 graduate and PhD students during his 60+ years at the University of Minnesota. The lessons that Herb taught extended far beyond the lecture-hall or the field – they were lessons in modesty, conciseness, kindness, loyalty, devotion to sharing and understanding, and survival (see Memories of HEWright by Bob Baker).\nAfter his PhD work in New Mexico and his visits to Europe and the Near East in the early 1950s, Herb became interested in the potential of pollen analysis as a tool for reconstructing environmental change and landscape history. Thanks to a grant from the Hill Family Foundation in 1956, he was able to establish in 1958 a pollen laboratory in Minnesota. Herb invited experienced European pollen analysts and palaeoecologists to help in the development of the laboratory and to help in advising students. Magnus Fries (Sweden) was the first to come in 1958, followed by Saskia Jelgersma (The Netherlands: 1959–60), William A Watts (Ireland: 1961 and later), Willem van Zeist (The Netherlands: 1960–61), Roel Janssen (The Netherlands: 1962–64 and later), Maj-Britt Florin (Sweden: 1964–65), Krystyna Wasylikova (Poland: 1964–65), Kazimierz Wasylik (Poland: 1965), Elizabeth Haworth (UK: 1967), Johanna Grüger (Germany: 1968–69), Eberhard Grüger (Germany: 1968–69), Hilary Birks (UK: 1970), H John B Birks (UK: 1970–71 and later), and, in later years, Jan Janssens (Belgium and Canada: 1980–89), Richard W Battarbee (UK: 1981–82), Svante Björck (Sweden: 1981–82 and later), and Ingemar Renberg (Sweden: 1991). With a separate grant from the Hill Family Foundation, the Limnological Research Center (LRC) was established in 1959. The pollen laboratory was incorporated within the LRC in 1963 when Herb became the LRC Director. The LRC rapidly developed expertise not only in palaeoecology but also in palaeolimnology and neolimnology with faculty members such as Joe Shapiro, Robert (‘Bob’) O Megard, Alan Brook, and Eville Gorham. The LRC attracted many foreign visitors for short (1–3 month) visits from Canada, UK, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovenia, France, Spain, and Japan. Its multi-national flavour was supplemented by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from Canada, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, China, and Japan. The LRC under Herb’s leadership became a major international centre for palaeoecological, palaeolimnological, and neolimnological research. Herb retired from being LRC director in 1990.\nThroughout his professional career, Herb conducted major and demanding research projects not only in Minnesota but also across North America from Florida via New Mexico to Alaska, as well as in the Yukon, Labrador, and Mexico. Abroad he worked in Norway, Sweden, Russia, Siberia, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Azores, Madeira, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Peru, Bolivia, and Antarctica. He made extended academic visits to Russia, China, Australia, and several European countries. He published more than 200 international scientific papers, edited 21 books or Special Issues of journals, and supervised at least 36 PhD dissertations and 38 MSc or MA theses in the University of Minnesota’s Departments of Geology, Ecology, and Botany, and its Center for Ancient Studies. He was involved as an invaluable advisor for countless more graduate students and post-doctoral visitors. Many of his students and post-doctoral visitors are now leading scholars and are making outstanding contributions to many different aspects of Quaternary research as well as to teaching, supervision, and mentoring.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright formally ‘retired’ from his Regents’ Professorship in 1988 at the mandatory (at that time) age of 70 and from being director of the Limnological Research Center in 1990. He continued to teach and advise graduate students for many years thereafter. In his retirement he participated in numerous sediment-coring expeditions to remote parts of the globe, including the high Peruvian Andes, Glacier Bay in Alaska, the Azores, the Bulgarian Pirin mountains, the Caucasus of Georgia, and the Siberian Altai. He was visiting Hilary and John Birks in Bergen in December 1988 when he decided to stay an extra day or two in Norway before returning to the USA. Fortunately, he was able to change his reservation that was for PanAm flight 103 on 21 December 1988, the flight that was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, to a later flight with a different carrier. Until about 2010, Herb was actively engaged in science with writing and editing. He travelled to Guadalajara in Mexico to receive on 16 December 2009 his Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Paleolimnology Association (Wright 2010). His last publication (Ammann et al. 2014) formed part of a festschrift volume in honour of Hilary Birks who worked with Herb on various projects since her post-doctoral year in the LRC in 1970.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright met his wife-to-be Rhea Jane Hahn (1921–1988) in church choirs at Harvard University and Radcliffe College in the early 1940s. They married on 27 June 1943 at the Moody Field Post Chapel, Valdosta, Georgia. Herb was then an air-cadet in the Army Air Corps and Rhea was a nursing student at Yale College of Nursing. They spent their honeymoon at Sea Island, Georgia followed by a short residence at Sebring, Florida. They had six sons (Richard (1944–), Peter (1948–1955), John (1950–), Rex (1953–1988), Andy (1955–), and Jeffrey (1959–)).\nHerb and his family enjoyed many cross-country skiing trips, sometimes with their neighbours in St Anthony Park, St Paul. His sons often accompanied Herb on field expeditions to core in, for example, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, Labrador, the Yukon, Minnesota, New Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. For many summers, Herb and Rhea rented a rustic cabin with no electricity on an island in Lake Minnetonka just west of the Twin Cities. Several families, some of whom were faculty at the University of Minnesota, would often have supper together in the summer evenings and enjoy the idyllic tranquillity of Lake Minnetonka.\nHerb greatly loved classical music (see below) and he regularly attended concerts of the Minnesota Orchestra (formerly known as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra), the St Paul Chamber Orchestra, and Music in the Park. Besides the music of Schubert and Brahms, he was very attracted to Faure’s Requiem. Herb once told Brigitta Ammann (pers. comm. 2015) that he would like Faure’s Requiem at his funeral but said “just too bad that I will not be able to hear it”. At his Memorial Service on 5 December 2015, the music was by Bach, Handel, Marcello, and Beethoven. He avidly read liberal newspapers and regularly listened to Minnesota public radio. Rhea also loved music and she played piano, flute, and recorder and taught piano in the 1950s–1960s. Rhea and Herb hosted local recorder groups in their home.\nHerb and Rhea were an important part of the ‘Hythe Street Regulars’ for over 50 years and the many visitors to Herb’s LRC quickly experienced the wonderful camaraderie of the ‘Regulars’ from Kemper Kirkpatrick, Kim and Ann Munholland, John and Judy Howe, Dick and Finette Magnuson, Bobbi and Bob Megard, and all their respective children. They made visitors from far afield feel very much at home, even in the midst of a fierce Twin Cities January night. Herb and Rhea became ‘second parents’ to many young children of their friends and colleagues.\n\n\n\nÅsa Björck listening captivated to her big favourite Herb, reading an exciting story, with Rhea Wright as an attentive spectator, Twin Cities, 1982 (photo by Svante Björck)\n\n\nHerb died peacefully at his St Anthony Park home in St Paul on 12 November 2015 after a long illness. Rhea predeceased him on 21 January 1988 as did sons Peter and Rex. His sons Richard (‘Dick’), John, Andy, and Jeffrey survive him along with his grandchildren Patrick, Christopher, Thierry, and Theora, and great-grandson Adrian, as do daughter-in-law Sylvie (widow of Rex), Vibeke, Christa, and Maria, partners of Dick, John, and Jeffrey, respectively, and Marianne Wright. For the last 14 years of his life, Herb was lovingly cared for by his dear friend and colleague Ivanka (‘Vania’) Stefanova.\n\n\n\n\nClassical music was a very important part of Herb’s life (Wright, unpublished letter 27 May 2001). He described himself as an “addict of classical music”. He met his wife-to-be Rhea in choirs at Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. Herb had sung in two local church choirs as a schoolboy – one because the choir-master organised a basketball team and the other because a small salary was paid for participating. By his own admission, Herb was not a good singer but he learnt to read music and carry a tune. In his first year at Harvard College, he took a course on music appreciation and leant all the proper forms and styles. He spent long hours in the listening rooms trying to memorise themes and dissect the musical structure. The professor was so deeply involved in the beginnings of music in Medieval times that the course never reached the 19th century! Herb’s fascination with music tempted him to volunteer as an usher at the monthly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the College auditorium. Herb also enlisted in the Harvard Glee Club along with the legendary Leonard Bernstein. Herb also joined the university chorus and he sang in the chorus for a recording of Beethoven’s Symphony no.9 (‘Choral Symphony’) by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After moving to Minnesota, Herb again joined the university chorus and again sang the Choral Symphony but this time with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the Minnesota Orchestra). He regularly attended its concerts over 60 years with season tickets for seats near the front on the right-hand side, exactly where he was an usher back in the early 1930s in Boston. He usually bought four or six season tickets and sold or gave them to friends or colleagues. He also keenly supported the St Paul Chamber Orchestra and was a friend of the Music in the Park series, now renamed The Schubert Club who dedicated their concert on 25 September 2016 to Herb, twelve days after his birthday. Herb Herb enjoyed listening to radio programmes that included interviews with soloists or directors commenting about the music they would be performing in the Twin Cities. He greatly enjoyed the articulate, informal, and talented English musician and scholar Christopher Hogwood talking as Artistic Director of the St Paul Chamber Orchestra to explain the connections between pieces that he would direct at the next concert. One such example of ingenious Hogwood programming that Herb greatly enjoyed was Tippett’s Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, Holst’s St Paul’s Suite Op.29, number 2, and A Fugal Concerto Op.40, number 2, Corelli’s Concerto Grosso in F Op.6, number 2 and Trio Sonata Opus 3, number 4, and Bach’s Fugue in B minor on a Theme of Corelli (BWV579).\nHerb’s musical tastes focused on the late 18th and the 19th centuries with the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, and to a lesser extent Haydn. He was fascinated by Schubert’s Eight (‘Unfinished’) Symphony. His wife’s tastes, as a recorder player, were more in the late 17th and early 18th centuries of the Baroque period. I once bought her and Herb an LP of the Academy of Ancient Music’s superb and stylistically unique rendering (1981) of Pachelbel’s Canon and Gigue directed by Christopher Hogwood. Rhea loved it so much that she almost wore the LP out. It was played at the wedding of their son Rex to Sylvie.\n\n\n\nDuring his long and distinguished scientific career, Herb Wright had many research interests and made major contributions to at least ten topics. The overarching aim of Herb’s activities was to reconstruct the late-Quaternary history of individual areas and ultimately of the world and to use these reconstructions to improve our understanding of the present and the future (Shane & Cushing 1991a; Wright 1973a). To Herb the term history had a broad meaning to include geological, geomorphological, climatic, biotic, and anthropological change over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (Shane & Cushing 1991a). Herb (Wright 1973a) discussed Quaternary science and public service in modern society with all its environmental problems. Herb concluded “many aspects of the projects in which one might become involved are interesting scientific problems themselves, apart from their application to an environmental crisis. A combination of intellectual stimulation and emotional satisfaction is hard to beat. I recommend it as a modest ingredient in an academic diet.” Clearly for Herb it was a very important diet that sustained him as a Quaternary scientist and active environmentalist for 70 years.\nChapters in Quaternary Landscapes (Shane & Cushing 1991b) review six of the ten topics discussed below – origins of food production and archaeology (Watson 1991), Quaternary glacial history and stratigraphy (Mangerud 1991), peat growth (Clymo 1991), palaeoecology (Ritchie 1991), palaeolimnology (Battarbee 1991), and climate and vegetational change (Kutzbach & Webb 1991). These papers were presented at a symposium in Minneapolis in May 1988 to honour Herb on the occasion of his formal retirement as Regents’ Professor. The additional four topics discussed below concern Herb’s contributions and legacies to fire history, conservation, and landscape management; field-craft and sediment coring; writing and editing; and scientific networking and collaboration.\n\n\nBefore being hired by the University of Minnesota, Herb Wright was a teaching instructor at Brown University (Providence, Rhode Island) (1945–1947) where he worked on glacial geology. During the summer of 1947, he went to coastal Lebanon to make a sedimentary and geomorphological study of the Ksar Akil Upper Palaeolithic rock shelter near Beirut (Wright 1951), as part of a Boston College–Fordham University excavation at the suggestion of Kirk Bryan Sr and Hallam Movius (1907-1987). The rock shelter is now recognised as an important site that encompasses Mousterian and Upper Palaeolithic industries in a 23-metre thick deposit. Herb wrote “I shudder to think that my field area was in West Beirut itself, where cemented coastal sand dunes and intercalated soils and marine shell beds suggested a story of environmental change” (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Initially Herb travelled each day by tram (street-car) from his lodgings at the American University of Beirut. He later lived with Jesuit archaeologists at the archaeological site. They were looked after by an Armenian cook who maintained an excellent field camp. Herb borrowed an old car and explored the marine terraces and other geomorphological features of the Lebanese coast and became fascinated by the environmental history and landscapes of the Near East (Wright 1996; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’).\nThe archaeological contacts that resulted from Herb’s 1947 Lebanon expedition led to him being engaged by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago as a field geologist to work with Robert J Braidwood (1907–2003) and others on the ‘hilly flanks’ of Iraq, in particular Iraqi Kurdistan. Herb worked there in 1951 when he had a leave of absence from the University of Minnesota for three months during which he held a Wenner-Gren Fellowship (Schwartz 1972). He determined the extent of erosion of the prehistoric site of Jarmo (the earliest city in the world) on top of a river bluff that had been eroded away. He also worked at Karim Shahir and the middle Palaeolithic site at Barda Balka (Wright 1952). There were inevitable adventures and misadventures on this 1951 expedition – vehicle malfunctions and other problems, running out of fuel, getting stuck in mud, illness, unusual food, etc. (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wadis’, ‘Another adventure with mudholes and empty gas tanks’, ‘Iraq March 14 1951, ‘Iraq Jan 30 1951’, ’51-22 Jarmo’).\n\nFieldwork problems in Iraq, 1951 (photos by Allan Martini)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese geo-archaeological studies and those of his in Lebanon in 1947 were some of the first geological interpretations of Near Eastern prehistoric sites and they served as a major stimulus for Herb’s interests in the role of climate in the development of civilisation, especially the question of the origins of agriculture; interests that he had acquired from his Harvard mentor Kirk Bryan Sr. When Herb saw the Kurdistan landscape (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’), he began to consider its history and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of a larger area than the Jarmo site. Braidwood’s main aim was to find evidence relevant to the causes of the transition from food gathering to food production and the origin of village life. Bob Braidwood therefore encouraged Herb to explore and travel throughout Kurdistan and the mountains of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey in search of former glaciers and relic landforms that might provide hints about past climate. These studies and travels coincided with the establishment of the US National Science Foundation and Braidwood developed the idea that any understanding of the origins of agriculture required a multi-disciplinary approach involving archaeology, prehistory, and the natural sciences (geology, botany, zoology). Radiocarbon dating was also developing rapidly at this time under the direction of WF Libby (1908-1980), a colleague of Braidwood at the University of Chicago, thereby providing a means to develop an absolute chronology of past events (Wright 1957a, 1996). This opened up many new research possibilities in prehistoric archaeology, palaeoenvironmental studies, and landscape history (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). In 1954–55 Herb – sponsored by a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Wenner-Gren Fellowship, the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute (Schwartz 1972), and its Iraq–Jarmo Project – began trying to decipher the environmental history of Iraqi Kurdistan on the basis of landforms and correlations and teleconnections with glacial events in Europe. He drove a Land Rover and trailer with his wife Rhea and family of three small boys from London to Baghdad by way of Interlaken, Graz, Belgrade, Istanbul, Damascus, and the pipeline road across the desert of Jordan (Wright 1996) and spent an adventurous year exploring Kurdistan and living in primitive Kurdish villages (Wright 1996; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). He published a detailed glacial history of the area (Wright 1961b) but the chronology was uncertain and its relevance to the origin of agriculture remained uncertain (Wright 1960, 1996).\n\n\n\nLake Zeribar, Zagros Mountains, Iran. Field-camp by the lake, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\nThe Iraqi revolution in 1957 precluded further work in Iraq, so activities shifted across the mountains into Iranian Kurdistan in 1960 (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Herb’s frustration with undated landforms, along with his developing interest in lakes and their sediments, resulted in him coring many small lakes in western Iran including Lake Zeribar north-west of Kermenshah (which he also cored in 1960, 1963, and 1970) in the Zagros Mountains and other sites later in eastern Turkey and Israel. He had several more field seasons in the Near East as part of Braidwood’s investigations of early villages and the origin of agriculture. With Krystyna Wasylikowa (Krakow), Willem van Zeist (Groningen), Bob Megard (Minnesota), and others Wright masterminded in the early 1960s a detailed multidisciplinary study of the Zeribar sediments, involving pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, cladocera, mollusca, geochemistry, stable isotopes, and radiocarbon dating (Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008). Herb and his colleagues found a reasonable correlation between the time when the regional vegetation changed from steppe to forest and the time when plants were first domesticated, and Herb subsequently developed several new hypotheses to link climatic change and cultural events (Wright 1968a, 1976a, 1977a; Wright & Thorpe 2003). These replaced the earlier ideas of Childe (1929) on the early domestication of plants and animals in the Near East.\nFollowing this early work in the Near East, Herb maintained a keen interest in multidisciplinary archaeological projects (Anfinson 2016). He worked with the archaeologist WA McDonald in the University of Minnesota Messenia Expedition on late Bronze Age environments at Osmanaga Lagoon in the Peloponnese of southern Greece (Wright 1984a; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). He assisted Tom Shay in his detailed palaeoecological analysis of the Itasca bison kill site (Shay 1971). Herb also initiated detailed palaeoenvironmental studies (pollen, charcoal, geochemistry) in the remote wilderness of Labrador in response to a suggestion of Bill Fitzhugh (Smithsonian Institute) that the interactions of prehistoric Native American and Inuit populations in that area were related to the movement of reindeer herds which depended on ground lichens as a major food resource (Farrand et al. 1990; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). It was hypothesised that the extent of lichen cover was a function of the occurrence and distribution of forest fires and that fire history could be reconstructed from charcoal fragments preserved in lake sediments. Herb and colleagues survived seven field seasons in Labrador: some of these involved having to live off ‘cream of Cladonia soup’ (made by Nancy Eyster-Smith) for a time and being forgotten by a bush-pilot and having Dan Engstrom and Henry Lamb hike and raft to Port Hope Simpson on the Labrador coast to get help (Wright 1996). Although the original archaeological premise was shown to be intractable (Farrand et al. 1990), this archaeological question inspired extensive and detailed palaeoecological studies on several aspects of the landscape history of Labrador (Wright 1985) (see also sections 6 and 7 below).\nHerb’s most recent involvement with prehistoric archaeology was in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia in response to questions raised by Kent Flannery (University of Michigan) about the environmental setting for the first hunting cultures in the highlands and by John Rick’s (Stanford University) excavations of cave sites that were apparently occupied contemporaneously with the nearby wasting glaciers (Farrand et al. 1990; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Expansion and then retreat of the still-existing glaciers during the last 1000-2000 years suggested major climatic changes. Archaeological surveys in areas close to the upper limit of cultivation indicated population shifts and other cultural changes prior to the Incan period (Seltzer & Hastorf 1990; Wright 1980a, 1986; Wright et al. 1989). Herb spent six summers in the Andes working with John Rick, Geoff Seltzer, Christine Hastdorf, Julie Stein, and Carrie Jennings, starting in Peru but shifting to Bolivia because of dangerous Peruvian guerrilla activities in the study areas. Other archaeological contributions by Herb include Wright (1974a, 2000, 2006) and Anfinson and Wright (1990) (see Anfinson 2016).\nIn 1989 Herb received an Award from the Archaeological Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (Farrand et al. 1990), and wrote when discussing his role as a geologist and palaeoecologist in multidisciplinary projects with archaeologists that “the director of an interdisciplinary project must be willing to spend the time and resources in facilitating peripheral adventures, such as providing a vehicle and perhaps a guide, arranging permission with appropriate authorities, and tolerating an absence from the site for extended periods. Beyond that, however, the director must also be willing to spend the time and intellectual effort to understand the purpose of such explorations and the research methods, and to learn about the results in detail, for it is the director’s ultimate responsibility to integrate these results into a synthesis that should be the ultimate goal for the project. It has been my good fortune to be associated with archaeologists who have made these commitments in time and energy, and I believe that their success in the profession is in some part a result of such an approach. What small scientific contributions I have made to archaeology can be attributed in part to their willingness to allow their resident geologist and paleoecologist to roam so widely, and in part to their interest in incorporating the results of such peregrinations into their archaeological thinking.” (Farrand et al. 1990).\n\n\n\nSoon after joining the Department of Geology, University of Minnesota in 1947, Herb Wright was urged by the Director of the Minnesota Geological survey to begin a revision of the complex glacial geology and Quaternary history of Minnesota with several ice-lobes criss-crossing the state of ‘ten thousand lakes’ (Schwartz 1972). This topic had largely been ignored since the pioneering studies by NH Winchell (1839–1914), Warren Upham (1850–1934), Frank Leveretta (1859–1943), Frederick B Sardeson (1866–1958), and WH Emmons (1876–1948) in the early part of the 20th century. Herb started work in Minnesota and the Great Lakes region in the summer of 1948. Herb’s studies and those of his graduate students such as Charles L Matsch (1930–2014), Edward J Cushing, Jim Zumberge, Stan Chernicoff, Barry Goldstein, Howard Mooers, Al Schneider, and Carrie Patterson (Jennings) helped decipher and understand the complex glacial history and resulting geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent areas with multiple ice-lobes, glacial surges, tunnel valleys, drumlins, eskers, pro-glacial lakes and their shore-lines, complex ice-advances and ice-retreats, inland sand-dunes, and periods of erosion and deposition in the Minnesota and Mississippi River valley as a result of glacial recession. These studies by Herb and his students and colleagues resulted in a large number of important primary publications. Herb provided two masterly reviews (Wright 1972a, 1972b) on the Quaternary history and physiography of Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand for list of papers\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor papers on the glacial geology and geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent areas by Herb Wright and his students and colleagues.\nBjörck S.

He was a regular participant on the Friends of the Pleistocene field trips. His first such trip was in May 1947 to the Finger Lakes areas of central New York. Many well-known American Quaternary scientists were on this trip including Hugh M Raup (1901-1995), Kirk Bryan Sr, Richard F Flint (1901-1976), and Richard P Goldthwait (1911-1992) (Friends of Pleistocene Geology 1947).\nHerb’s keen sense of adventure and his constant drive for interdisciplinary studies led to a month-long expedition in 1971 to the Klutlan Glacier in the wilderness of the St Elias Mountains of the Yukon (Wright 1980b, 1996). The impressively surging Klutlan Glacier with large areas of spruce forest growing on dead-ice was a possible modern analogue for the late-glacial landscape of Minnesota (Florin & Wright 1969; Wright 1976b, 1981a; Wright & Stefanova 2004). Studies were made on the flora and vegetation (Birks 1980a), soils (Jacobson & Birks 1980), modern pollen and recent vegetational history (Birks 1980b), limnology (Whiteside et al. 1980), lake development (Bradbury & Whiteside 1980), glacial geology (Driscoll 1976, 1980a, 1980b), geomorphology (Watson 1980), and hydrology (Driscoll 1980b) of the Klutlan Glacier and its ice-cored moraines. The 1971 Klutlan party consisted of Herb and a glacial geologist (Fletcher Driscoll), a plant ecologist (John Birks), two limnologists (John Platt Bradbury, Melbourne (‘Mel’) C Whiteside), and a philosopher of science (Richard (‘Red’) A Watson) whose task was to observe how these people applied different approaches to a common problem during a month in the wilderness (Wright 1996). Fletcher Driscoll and George Jacobson returned in 1972 to complete hydrological and ice-wastage measurements and soil-development studies. George and Fletcher were not at all thrilled that the provisions Herb had arranged for their month-long stay on the Klutlan Glacier in 1972 consisted entirely of a large bag of rice and a large bag of raisins (George Jacobson pers. comm. 2016)! Besides various adventures and exciting and challenging camp-fire discussions, the 1971 and 1972 Klutlan studies stimulated more detailed limnological, palaeolimnological, and hydrological studies on neoglacial moraines in the oceanic Glacier Bay, Alaska by Dan Engstrom, Sheri Fritz, and Jim Almendinger (Engstrom & Fritz 2006; Engstrom et al. 2000; Fritz et al. 2004) often with Herb, Geoff Seltzer (1969-2005), and others as devoted field helpers.\n\n\n\nThe establishment of the pollen laboratory at the University of Minnesota in 1958 with a grant from the Hill Family Foundation in St Paul was an important stage in Herb Wright’s scientific activities (Schwartz 1972; Almendinger and Jennings 2016). During his doctoral studies in New Mexico in the early 1940s, he had already developed an interest in lakes and their sediments as a potential source of data for inferring relative chronologies and vegetational as well as environmental and climatic history. His research in the Near East and Minnesota in the early 1950s continued to inspire and stimulate this interest.\nHerb’s initial awareness of the potential of pollen analysis as a tool in reconstructing landscape history, past climates, and relative chronologies probably came from his Harvard mentor Kirk Bryan Sr who closely followed the European literature on pollen analysis and climate history in the 1940s and 1950s. Herb’s interest was stimulated further by the publication of Edward S Deevey’s (1914-1988) masterly review of Pleistocene biogeography (Deevey 1949) and by his own travels around Europe in the early 1950s. Besides meeting many European Quaternary geologists, Herb also visited the main pollen-analytical centres in Europe and met Max Welten (1904-1984) in Bern, Franz Firbas (1902-1964) in Göttingen, Johannes (Johs) Iversen (1904-1972) and Svend Th Andersen (1926-2009) in Copenhagen, Tage Nilsson (1905-1986) in Lund, Gunnar Erdtman (1897-1973) in Stockholm, Knut Fægri (1909-2001) in Bergen, and Harry Godwin (1901-1985) in Cambridge.\nHerb recalled (Wright, unpublished note ‘Sils Remarks’) that whilst a graduate student and after he discovered lakes and their sediments were suitable for pollen analysis he gained “a background in plant identification and ecology. I took to a course offered by the great plant taxonomist ML Fernald (1873-1950), editor of the authoritative Gray’s New Manual of Botany. But I was soon discouraged by the requirement to draw in Indian ink the leaves of mostly tropical plants mounted on herbarium sheets and to memorize the attributes of tropical plant families. This seemed not to be a productive way to approach vegetation history”. So as Herb admitted (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen), “Not being an avid microscopist, I called upon experienced European specialists to establish a pollen laboratory at Minnesota and to help in advising students.” On the advice of Johs Iversen, Herb invited Magnus Fries (1917-1987) from Uppsala to come and develop the laboratory and to train a group of talented graduate students (Wright 1994). Fries worked in Minnesota during 1958, established the pollen laboratory, started building up its modern pollen reference collections, trained graduate students such as Edward (‘Ed’) J Cushing, Louis (‘Lou’) J Maher Jr, Robert (‘Bob’) C Bright (1928-1995), John (‘Jock’) McAndrews, Thomas C Winter (1936-2010), and Harvey L Patten, and did a detailed palynological study of Weber Lake in north-east Minnesota (Fries 1962).\nFries was followed by Saskia (‘Kiek’) Jelgersma (1929-2012), Willem van Zeist, and C Roel Janssen (1930-2015) (all from The Netherlands), William (‘Bill’) Watts from Ireland (1930-2010), Krystyna Wasylikova and Kazimierz (‘Kazik’) Wasylik (1925-2000) from Poland, Johanna and Eberhard Grüger from Germany, Hilary and H John B Birks from the UK, and Svante Björck from Sweden. All these visitors contributed significantly to reconstructing floristic, vegetational, and climatic history of Minnesota and neighbouring states and, in the case of Bill Watts, of many other states in the eastern, central, and south-eastern USA.\nThe publications by Winter (1962), Fries (1962), Cushing (1963), McAndrews (1966), and Wright and co-authors (Wright et al. 1963) presented the first detailed modern pollen diagrams from different ecological regions of Minnesota. Many of these studies revealed the dynamic behaviour of the prairie-forest ecotone in the Holocene. In his first visit to Minnesota in 1961, Bill Watts developed stratigraphic quantitative plant-macrofossil analysis that built on the pioneering palynological study at Kirchner Marsh (Winter 1961, 1962; Wright et al. 1963) to produce one of the first ever quantitative plant-macrofossil studies (Watts & Winter 1966). Watts made similar studies in northern Minnesota, South Dakota, and Nebraska (Watts & Bright 1968; Watts & Wright 1966; Wright & Watts 1969) before embarking on studies on the vegetational history of the south-eastern states (e.g. Grimm et al. 1993; Hansen et al. 2001; Watts 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1980a, 1980b, 1983; Watts & Hansen 1987, 1994; Watts & Stuiver 1980; Watts et al. 1992), central Appalachia and the New Jersey coastal plain (Watts 1979), Bermuda (Watts & Hansen 1986), and Mexico (Watts & Bradbury 1982) (see Chapter 6 in Watts 2008).\nBill Watts visited the LRC and worked with Herb for over 40 years. Besides providing an unrivalled amount of new information about the late-Quaternary floristic, vegetational, and environmental history of the Great Lakes region, south-east USA, and Appalachia, Bill pursued many other careers (Watts 2008). He was a lecturer and subsequently a professor at Trinity College Dublin, as well as Trinity’s Provost from 1981 to 1991. He was an outstanding Provost and he initiated significant modernisation and expansion of research and teaching within the College. He was also active in Irish nature conservation, Dublin hospital management, President of the Royal Irish Academy 1980–82, and chaired various Irish charitable trusts. Despite all these duties, Bill remained active in research, particularly the vegetation history of Florida and Italy (Watts 2008).\nBill also developed an interest in the Pacific North West and co-supervised Cathy Whitlock in her work in Washington and Oregon (Barnosky 1984, 1985a, 1985b; Barnosky et al. 1987a; Whitlock 1992; Whitlock & Bartlein 1997; Leopold et al. 2016). Cathy also spent time at the LRC when she worked on the pollen stratigraphy of Elk Lake (Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993) and of the Red Lake peatlands (Janssens et al. 1992).\n\n\n\nCathy Whitlock and Herb Wright with a core of surface-mud from a small lake in Yellowstone National Park, 1987 (photo by Dan Engstrom)\n\n\nOne of Herb’s MSc students Richard (‘Dick’) G Baker learnt macrofossils from Bill Watts (Baker 1965) and went on to do detailed and important macrofossil work in Yellowstone (Baker 1976) and in the Midwest (Baker et al. 1989, 1996, 2002, 2009).\nSeveral of Herb’s early doctoral students spent a year working in some of the major European palynological laboratories (e.g. Ed Cushing in Copenhagen, Lou Maher in Cambridge, Jock McAndrews in Groningen, Bob Bright in Uppsala) allowing them to benefit directly from leading European researchers.\nThe activities of the pollen laboratory were not confined to Minnesota and adjacent states. Willem van Zeist, Krystyna Wasylikova, Kazik Wasylik, and Bob Megard studied pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, and cladocerans, respectively, in cores from Lake Zeribar in Iran (e.g. Megard 1967; Snyder et al. 2001; van Zeist 1967; van Zeist & Bottema 1977; van Zeist & Wright 1963; Wasylikowa 1967, 2008; Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008; Wasylikowa et al. 2006). The geochemistry and stable oxygen isotopes were also studied later (Stevens et al. 2001, 2008; Wright 1966). These investigations plus those on Charales oospores, molluscs, and charred plant macrofossils made Lake Zeribar one of the most palaeoecologically intensively studied lakes in the world with multiproxy records extending to about 48,000 years ago (Wasylikowa et al. 2008). To provide a factual basis for the interpretation of the Zeribar pollen stratigraphy, Wright, McAndrews, and van Zeist (1967) did an extensive survey of modern vegetation and its pollen rain in western Iran. This study showed the importance of studying modern pollen assemblages as an aid to the interpretation of fossil assemblages. The Lake Zeribar studies initiated by Herb in 1960 (Megard B 2016; Megard RO 2016) have provided unique insights into environmental and climate history relevant to our understanding of the origins of agriculture in the Near East (Wright & Thorpe 2003).\nDespite all this activity on Minnesotan and Iranian vegetational and environmental history, Herb maintained an interest in the arid landscapes of the American South-West where he had done his doctoral research. The Chuska Mountains in north-western New Mexico are dotted with many small lakes so Herb started to explore these (Wright 1964; Wright & Bent 1968). Whilst the sediments of Minnesotan lakes are most effectively cored through ice in the winter or early spring, the Chuska Mountains are inaccessible in winter so Herb used primitive wooden coring platforms and rafts made of truck-type inner-tubes for summer coring. Cores from Dead Man Lake in the Chuska Mountains yielded a long Wisconsin-stage record (Bent & Wright 1963; Wright et al. 1973b). Detailed quantitative pollen-morphological studies (Hansen & Cushing 1973) showed that Pinus flexilis (limber pine) was present in the past, although today it grows farther north in the Rockies.\nAs well as this work on late-Quaternary vegetational history, pioneering studies in Herb’s pollen laboratory on modern local-scale pollen deposition in relation to vegetation (Janssen 1966, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c, 1973, 1984), differential pollen preservation and redeposited pollen (Cushing 1964, 1967a), delimitation of pollen assemblage zones and their mapping in space and time (Cushing 1967b), using pollen ratios to identify elevational limits of different conifer genera using modern pollen assemblages (Maher 1963), experimenting with different pollen sums (Wright & Patten 1963), exploiting transects of pollen sites across natural climate gradients to explore past vegetation and climate dynamics (McAndrews 1966; see also Nelson & Hu 2008), and developing integrated pollen, plant macrofossil, and vegetation studies in the Rockies (Bright 1966) were all important conceptual and methodological contributions to Quaternary palynology and palaeoecology as a whole. Within about 10 years Herb’s pollen laboratory had become the leading centre for Quaternary pollen analysis in North America and one of the leading centres in the world with a strongly international flavour. Pollen analysis and vegetational history continued to be a major part of Herb’s scientific activities until his retirement (and beyond), through new visitors from Germany, England, and Sweden and returning visitors from the Netherlands, Ireland, and England, and via the many outstanding collaborators and graduate students who worked on a wide range of projects involving pollen analysis, often linked to specific ecological or Quaternary geological problems.\nA major mainstay in the pollen laboratory was Barbara Hansen who worked with Herb and various colleagues on pollen analyses from a wide range of geographical areas for many years. Within North America, Barbara has worked in North Dakota (Hansen & Wright 1987), Kentucky (Wrightet al. 1966), Minnesota (Janssenset al. 1992), New England (Fosteret al. 2006; Parshall et al. 2003; Oswald et al. 2007), Labrador (Engstrom & Hansen 1985), Hudson Bay Lowlands (Glaseret al. 2004a), Washington (Hansen & Easterbrook 1974), Alaska (Engstrom et al. 1990; Hansen & Engstrom 1996), Florida (Grimm et al. 1993; Hansen 2006; Hansenet al. 2001; Wattset al. 1992), and Bermuda (Watts & Hansen 1986). Further afield, Barbara has done major pollen-analytical studies in Guatemala (Johnsonet al. 2001), and Peru and Ecuador (Bush & Hansen 2005; Hansen 1995a, 2003; Hansen & Rodbell 1995; Hansenet al. 1984, 1994; Wrightet al. 1989), and even in Mongolia (Fowellet al. 2003). She has perfected conifer stomata analysis in North America (Hansen 1995b; Hansenet al. 1996) and resolved several critical pollen morphological problems (Hansen & Cushing 1973; Hansen & Engstrom 1985). Barbara’s friends and colleagues, especially Herb, were delighted when in 2001 she was awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award by the University of Minnesota.\n\n\n\nWith the ever-increasing interdisciplinary nature of many of Herb Wright’s research activities involving lake sediments and the importance of lakes in the Minnesotan landscape, it was natural that in 1959 a Limnological Research Center (LRC) was established within the University of Minnesota with the support of a separate grant from St Paul’s Hill Family Foundation. Herb became the director of the LRC in 1963 and the pollen laboratory was incorporated into the LRC within the Department of Geology and Geophysics. As he had done in the early days of the pollen laboratory, Herb enticed several leading European palaeolimnologists to come and work in the LRC, including Maj-Britt Florin (1905-1993) and Ingemar Renberg from Sweden and Elizabeth Haworth and Richard (‘Rick’) W Battarbee from England. Herb also attracted many talented post-doctoral palaeolimnologists including Bob Megard, John Platt Bradbury (1936-2005), John C Kingston (1949-2004), Richard (‘Dick’) B Brugam, Mel Whiteside, and Thomas Crisman and recruited several outstanding graduate students (e.g. Sherilyn C Fritz, Daniel R Engstrom) to work on different palaeolimnological projects (Wright 1994). A wide range of such projects quickly developed (e.g. Bright 1968; Winter & Wright 1977; Wright 1966, 1981b, 1992a, 2010). The original emphasis was on diatoms (e.g. Bradbury 1975), cladocerans (e.g. Megard 1964, 1967; Quade 1969), and ostracods, but broadened as new techniques were developed and refined such as pigment analysis, stable-isotope analyses, sediment geochemistry, mineralogy, and magnetics. Studies on lake-level changes and palaeohydrological modelling of prairie lakes (e.g. JE Almendinger 1990, 1993; Digerfeldt et al. 1992; Winter & Wright 1977) and on lake-sedimentation processes (Almquist-Jacobson et al. 1992) were also pursued.\nImportant studies on lake eutrophication were made in the 1970s (Birks et al. 1976; Bradbury 1975; Bradbury & Megard 1972; Bradbury & Waddington 1973; Brugam 1979; Gorham & Sanger 1976), often involving a multiproxy approach with pollen and diatom analyses and sediment geochemistry. Palaeolimnological techniques such as diatom analysis, pigment analysis, or geochemistry were applied to several ‘classic’ Herb Wright sites such as Kirchner Marsh (Brugam 1980; Florin 1970; Florin & Wright 1969; Sanger & Gorham 1972) and Pickerel Lake (Dean & Schwalb 2000; Haworth 1972).\nElk Lake in north-west Minnesota became a site for much LRC palaeolimnological research (Anderson et al. 1993; Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Birks et al. 1976; Bradbury & Dean 1993; Bradbury and Dieterich-Rurup 1993; Bradbury et al. 1993; Brugam 1993; Dean et al. 1984; Megard et al. 1993; Sanger & Hay 1993; Stark 1976; Whitlock et al. 1993; Wright 1993; Zeeb & Smol 1993). The first study (Stark 1976) involved collecting seven sediment cores and 25 surface samples from a transect across the lake. The surface samples were used to establish the ostracod, molluscan, and chironomid assemblages at different water depths. Stark (1976) determined the fossil composition for 14-25 levels in each of the seven cores to reconstruct the trophic sequence with respect to the sediment type (Wright 2010). The environmental settings for the trophic histories were inferred from skeletal pollen diagrams prepared for each core. This demanding multi-proxy study was all done by Donna Stark for her doctoral study. A second study at Elk Lake (Birks et al. 1976) concerned recent lake responses to catchment changes. The study involved three lakes, two badly polluted (Sallie Lake and St Clair Lake) and one control (Elk Lake) and pollen, plant macrofossil, cladoceran, and diatom analyses (Birks 2016). The third and major palaeolimnological study at Elk Lake involved (after several unsuccessful coring attempts) a 22-m-long series of cores from a continuously laminated sequence of post-glacial (10,400 years) sediment recovered from 29.6 m water depth in the deepest part of Elk Lake in 1978 and 1982. These cores were intensively studied by several investigators for their pollen (Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993), diatoms (Bradbury & Dietrich-Rurup 1993; Brugam 1993), chrysophyte cysts (Zeeb & Smol 1993), charcoal (Clark 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993), geochemistry (Dean 1993; Dean & Megard 1993; Dean et al. 1993), mineralogy (Anderson 1993; Dean 1993), stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (Dean & Stuiver 1993), pigments (Sanger & Hay 1993), and sedimentation (Dean & Megard 1993; Nuhfer et al. 1993; Sprowl 1993). The results of this remarkable study were published as 20 papers in a Geological Society of American Special Paper edited by J Platt Bradbury and Walter E Dean (Bradbury & Dean 1993). Herb had been involved in many attempts at obtaining continuous cores from the deep hole of Elk Lake from 1967 to 1982 and he had many more failures than successes! 1970 produced a successful continuous core but on our return to Minneapolis the trailer containing the cores became detached and the cores were badly damaged and unusable. Herb was mortified and silent, but in a day or two he was talking quietly about a possible return to Elk Lake! He had to wait until 1971 for that.\n\nElk Lake, Itasca State Park, north-west Minnesota, in July 1970 (left) and coring its sediments from the ice in March 1970 (right) (photos by John Birks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her 1970 stay at the LRC, Hilary Birks examined the relationship between modern assemblages of seeds and fruits in surface sediments and aquatic vegetation in over 50 Minnesotan lakes across the state (Birks 1973). This innovative study provided basic information on macrofossil representation today as a guide for interpreting fossil assemblages. Bob Bright examined modern diatom assemblages in relation to water chemistry in Minnesotan lakes (Bright 1968). This study was extended by Dick Brugam (Brugam 1993).\nAnother innovative study was initiated by Rick Battarbee whilst he was a visiting researcher at the LRC in 1981-82. This involved lakes in the Northern Great Plains along gradients of lake-water salinity and conductivity (Fritz 1990; Fritz & Battarbee 1988; Fritz et al. 1991, 1993; Radle et al. 1989). Work on the history of the Northern Great Plains has now been extended by Dan Engstrom, Sheri Fritz, Eric Grimm, Jim Clark, Emi Ito, Kate Laird, Brian Cumming, Will Hobbs, and others using diatoms, pollen, charcoal, ostracods, isotope ratios of ostracod carapaces, and models of groundwater flow (e.g. Barnosky et al. 1987b; Brown et al. 2005; Clark et al. 2001, 2002; Dean & Schwalb 2000; Grimm 2011; Grimm et al. 2011; Hobbs et al. 2011; Laird et al. 1996; Valero-Garces et al. 1997). Related multi-disciplinary work has been done in the Nebraska Sand Hills (e.g. Schmieder et al. 2011, 2012), an area that fascinated Herb since his early work there with Bill Watts (Watts & Wright 1966), in the Yellowstone National Park (Engstrom et al. 1991), and in the Eastern Prairie Peninsula in Illinois (Nelson et al. 2006).\nWhilst visiting Hilary and John Birks in Cambridge, UK, in 1979 Herb asked if there were any nearby lakes that needed coring. Herb, John Birks, and several Cambridge researchers including Henry Lamb, Pete Coxon, Brian Huntley, and Mary Edwards visited Diss Mere in Norfolk and raised a 13 m core from the lake centre. When we got to the lake, Herb realised that he had been there before, in 1944 when he was based near Bury St Edmonds, and he had wondered then how this perfectly circular basin had formed. The sediment core collected in May 1979 and a second deeper core collected in 1980, provided the material for detailed pollen analysis by Sylvia M Peglar and for detailed diatom analysis by Sherilyn C Fritz that formed major parts of their two doctoral theses, one in Bergen and one in Minnesota. This work led to important publications about lake ontogeny, the relationship between lake-catchment and land-use, the likely cause of the elm decline in the mid Holocene, changing land-use, and the formation of annually laminated sediments in Diss Mere (Fritz 1989; Peglar 1993a, 1993b; Peglar & Birks 1993; Peglar et al. 1984, 1989). None of this work would ever have been done if Herb had not asked if there was a nearby lake to core!\nThe LRC quickly developed expertise in modern limnology, phytoplankton ecology, lake restoration management, and biomanipulations of lakes through its Associate Director Joseph Shapiro and affiliated faculty members including Bob Megard, Eville Gorham, Alan Brook, and Hans-Olaf Pfannkuch. The Wednesday-evening seminar series at Herb’s home was extended to include one quarter devoted to limnology and one to palaeoecology in order to promote the interdisciplinary heart of the LRC and for many years these were active interactions among the LRC palaeoecological and neolimnological graduate students and post-graduate fellows, including limnologists such as Val Smith, Edward Swain, Michael Lynch, Bruce Forsberg, and David Wright. When Herb retired as Director of the LRC, Kerry Kelts (1947-2001) was appointed Director until 2000 (Johnson & Talbot 2002). Emi Ito is now the LRC Director and she has established excellent facilities for stable-isotope analyses in palaeolimnology, which were close to Wright’s interests (Hu et al. 1977, 1999; Stevens et al. 2006). The LRC hosts the LacCore – the national lacustrine core facility – a major research facility for state-of-the-art handling and logging of lake-sediment cores.\n\n\n\nMuch of Herb Wright’s research was at a local (e.g. Lake Zeribar) or regional (e.g. Minnesota) scale (Wright 1996) but in 1977 he and Ed Cushing with John E Kutzbach and Thompson (‘Tom’) Webb III from the University of Wisconsin and Brown University, respectively, initiated a group called COHMAP (Climates of the Holocene – Mapping Based on Pollen Data). The aim was to attempt for the terrestrial realm what the CLIMAP project (Climate: Mapping, Analysis, and Prediction; a multi-institutional consortium led by John Imbrie (1925-2016), James D Hays, Nicholas J Shackleton (1937–2006) and Andrew McIntyre) had done so successfully in the marine realm (CLIMAP Project Members 1976, 1981; Gates 1976). CLIMAP had, for the first time, combined results of general circulation models of past climate with palaeoceanographic data (primarily foraminifera). COHMAP quickly became global in its research extent and in the climate proxies it considered (terrestrial pollen, lake-levels, marine plankton, pack-rat middens). It changed its name to the Co-operative Holocene Mapping Project after incorporating researchers from the UK, Canada, and New Zealand and from other universities in the USA. Masterminded by John Kutzbach, Herb, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein and many others (Wright et al. 1993), COHMAP focused on simulating past climates at 18,000, 15,000, 12,000, 9000, 6000, 3000, and 0 years ago and comparing the model simulations with the available palaeoclimate data (COHMAP Members 1988; Wright & Bartlein 1993).\nCOHMAP’s modelling experiment results show how orbitally induced changes in insolation and changes in surface boundary conditions affect regional climates and hence the observed broad-scale changes in vegetation, marine plankton, and hydrology (COHMAP Members 1988). COHMAP was a major turning point in Holocene climate research for several reasons. First, it used what were then state-of-the-art general circulation models to simulate palaeoclimate under specified boundary conditions. Second, it resulted in detailed compilations and syntheses of palaeoclimate proxy data that were then used in data-model comparisons. Third, it considered the global climate as a whole and revealed the strong regional interconnections between different components of the Earth’s climate system. Fourth, it revealed the remarkable spatial and temporal variation in circulation patterns and climate at 3000-year intervals during the Holocene (Wright 1996; Wright et al. 1993).\nHerb played a major part in COHMAP because of his deep curiosity about the Earth’s climate system, his extensive knowledge of late-Quaternary history, his willingness to share data, his synthesis with Neil Roberts of the vegetation, lake-level, and climate histories of the Near East (Roberts & Wright 1993), his lead editorship of the large COHMAP volume (Wright et al. 1993; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’), and in making one of its first detailed data-model comparisons for 18,000 years ago for North America using the COHMAP climate model simulations and extensive palaeoclimatic and geological data (Kutzbach & Wright 1985).\nCOHMAP was a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research (Birks 2008) and Herb was an important contributor to this paradigm shift, or in his words part of the “breakthroughs in Ice-Age history” (Wright 1996). COHMAP was a model of multi-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration with its yearly meetings that brought together all the principal investigators, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows from the many laboratories involved to discuss and advance ideas about late-Quaternary palaeoclimate. Herb greatly enjoyed and valued this approach to collaborative research involving early-, mid-, and late-career scientists, all with a common scientific interest.\nBecause of the highly dynamic nature of Holocene climatic and biotic changes (Hu et al. 1999), Herb wrote several important critiques and reviews of chronostratigraphic classification in which he argued that formal chronostratigraphic procedures may not be appropriate or useful when one has, as in the Holocene, an absolute chronology (Watson & Wright 1980; Wright 1976c, 1981c). He also wrote valuable reviews about the Quaternary in general (Wright 1989a), interglacial pollen records (Wright 1972c), palaeoclimates (Wright 1992b, 1995), vegetation history and climate change (Wright 1981a), and Holocene chronologies (Wright et al. 2004).\n\n\n\nMinnesota has more peat than any other US state except Alaska. The northern Minnesotan peatlands exhibit spectacular surface patterns with forested islands, ovoid islands, water tracks, sedge lawns, raised bogs, flarks, and other surface features. These patterns are most clearly seen when viewed from the air (see, for example, plates 1-16 in Wright et al. 1992). They reflect the complex interactions between vegetation and local environment. In the early 1950s, Donald B Lawrence (1911-1996), a plant ecologist at the University of Minnesota, showed Herb Wright some aerial photographs of the Red Lake peatland taken by a Naval Reserve pilot on training flights. Herb, who was fascinated by aerial photographs and landforms at a range of spatial scales, was immediately struck by the vegetation patterns but was puzzled by their nature and possible origin. Don Lawrence and Herb set out a set of stakes in one patterned area to test the hypothesis that the peat ridges resulted from soil or peat creep, possibly triggered by frost activity. After a year the stakes were removed but no significant movement was detected (Heinselman 1992).\n\n\n\nMyrtle Lake (north-east Minnesota) peatland surface patterns of string ‘flarks’ running from a mineral-rich area, October 1970 (photo by John Birks)\n\n\nMiron (‘Bud’) L Heinselman (1920-1993) began his doctoral research on the ecology and growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) on the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands east of the prairies of the Red River Valley in northern Minnesota. He attended several of Herb’s courses on glacial geology and geomorphology and Herb joined Bud’s doctoral committee. They became life-long friends with many common interests, most particularly conservation and management (see the next section of Fire History). Herb encouraged widening Bud’s doctoral research topic to include peatland hydrology and the striking vegetational patterns that are so characteristic of these peatlands. Heinselman (1963) concluded that the peatland patterns were examples of a whole suite of peatland surface-patterns that occur in different forms around the entire circum-boreal region (e.g. Sjörs 1959, 1961).\nSome of Herb’s students (e.g. Griffin 1975, 1977) and colleagues (e.g. Janssen 1967b, 1968, 1984) began studies on the modern vegetation and pollen assemblages and on the peat and pollen stratigraphy of these northern Minnesotan peatlands. Heinselman (1970) completed investigations on the history of Myrtle Lake and the development of the vast peatlands north-west of the lake. As a result of these and other studies, Bud and Herb became actively aware that pulp-wood logging, Christmas-tree harvesting, and the use of Muskeg tractors (bombardiers) were having an impact on these fragile ecosystems. The great impacts of possible drainage, road construction, and peat mining were also in their minds (Heinselman 1992). In 1962 the Myrtle Lake peatland was designated a research natural area—the Lake Agassiz Peatlands National Area—and in 1964 a Registered National Natural Landmark. However, its official registration was never accomplished because of local opposition. Then in 1975 the Minnesota gas company (Minnegasco) wanted to lease 300,000 acres of the Red Lake peatland for peat mining. That proposal prompted the first major efforts to protect some of Minnesota’s most distinctive patterned peatlands. Fortunately, the Minnegasco threat never materialised but it resulted in the extensive and detailed studies in the Minnesota Peat Program. These studies included flora, fauna, vegetation, hydrology, ecology, palaeoecology, history, peatland development, and human influences and they were published together in the book The Patterned Peatlands of Minnesota edited by Herb Wright, Barbara A Coffin, and Norman E Aaseng (Wright et al. 1992). The threats to these peatlands and all the research focused on these peatlands stimulated concern and interest in designating certain peatlands for protection against future disturbance. On 4 June 1991 Governor Arne Carlson signed into law the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991 that dedicated all 146,239 acres of state-owned lands in the core areas of the 18 peatlands as scientific and natural areas (Aaseng & Djupstrom 1992).\nHerb’s fascination with these Minnesotan patterned peatlands and the origin and development of the patterns led to major projects on peatland ecology and palaeoecology not only in Minnesota but also elsewhere in eastern North America and in the Hudson Bay Lowlands with Jan Janssens (e.g. Janssens et al. 1992), Paul H Glaser (e.g. Glaser 1987a, 1987b, 1992; Glaser & Janssens 1986; Glaser et al. 1981, 1990, 2004b; Wright & Glaser 1983), George A King, and David R Foster. Besides research on patterned bog ecology and development in Labrador (Foster & Glaser 1986; Foster & King 1984; Foster et al. 1983, 1988a; Glaser & Foster 1984), David Foster, Herb, and associates also studied patterned mire development in Sweden (Almquist-Jacobson & Foster 1995; Foster & Fritz 1987; Foster & Jacobson 1990; Foster & Wright 1990; Foster et al. 1988b). Between them, Herb, David Foster, and Paul Glaser also studied aspects of mire development in Switzerland (Ammann et al. 2013), northern Norway, and Ireland.\n\n\n\nBesides peatland ecology, Bud Heinselman intensively researched the role of natural fire in northern conifer-dominated (Pinus spp., Picea spp.) forests, particularly in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) of north-eastern Minnesota’s Superior National Forest. He had canoed this wilderness area since he was a boy. Between 1960 and 1974, Bud and Albert (‘Al’) M Swain, a doctoral student of Ed Cushing, canoed through parts of BWCA in the summers and took incremental cores for tree-ring counting from pine trees, mainly Pinus resinosa (red pine) to reconstruct the stand age-structure and fire history in different parts of the BWCA. Bud located and mapped the remaining virgin, unlogged old-growth forests dating back to 1595 within the million acres of the BWCA. An obvious question was could the natural fire history be extended further back in time by analysing charcoal particles in lake sediments, ideally with annual laminae (varves) to provide an absolute chronology for the charcoal peaks? Herb, Bud, and Ed Cushing set out not only to find a suitable lake with annual laminae but also to work out how to recover undisturbed laminae from the near-surface sediment without having the laminated structure disrupted by escaping gas bubbles (ebullition). The 31-metre deep Lake of the Clouds in Lake County, north-east Minnesota on the border with Canada was selected and cored because of its laminated sediments. It was one of the first sites whose uppermost sediments were sampled by an effective freeze-corer improvised on site by Herb, Bud, Ed Cushing, Al Swain, Noel Potter, and Mel Whiteside (see Wright 1980c for details of freeze-corers and ‘frozen fingers’).\nAlan J Craig constructed a complete Holocene pollen diagram (Craig 1972) for Lake of the Clouds and Al Swain (Swain 1973; see also Swain 1980) reconstructed a detailed record of charcoal and hence fire history for the last 1000 years, showing an average fire frequency of approximately 60-70 years with a range of 20-100 years. It was clear from Bud and Al Swain’s extensive field observations and Al’s (1973) palaeoecological studies that “fire largely determined the composition and structure of the pre-settlement vegetation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as the vegetation mosaic on the landscape and the habitat patterns for wildlife. It also influenced nutrient cycles, and energy pathways, and helped maintain the diversity, productivity, and long-term stability of the ecosystem. Thus the whole ecosystem was fire-dependent. […] To restore the natural ecosystem of the Canoe Area fire should soon be reintroduced through a program of prescribed fires and monitored lightning fires. Failing this, major unnatural, perhaps unpredictable, changes in the ecosystem will occur.” (Heinselman 1973).\nTo highlight fire history and ecology, and the use of fire in management, Herb and Bud organised a symposium and field excursion devoted to the ecological role of fire in natural conifer forests of western and northern America at the August 1972 meetings of the Ecological Society of America and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. The symposium papers were published in the journal Quaternary Research rather than in a more strictly ecological journal to emphasise the basically historical nature of the role of fire in natural forest ecosystems (Heinselman & Wright 1973; Wright & Heinselman 1973).\nWright (1974b) provided an important and wide-ranging critical review of landscape development, forest fires, and wilderness management in which he argued that fire may provide the long-term stability needed to preserve certain conifer-dominated forest ecosystems. It is one of the earliest papers where palaeoecological studies were used to suggest management and conservation policies. His approach of integrating long-term palaeoecological data into contemporary and future landscape management has been elegantly extended by Whitlock et al. (1991) to the Yellowstone National Park.\nIn the 1970s Herb and Bud campaigned tirelessly to save the BWCA as a wilderness area. Bud and others founded the Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness in 1976 to push for new federal legislation to protect the BWCA. Their efforts largely succeeded in October 1978 when Congress passed the BWCA Wilderness Bill and expanded the area by 50,000 acres and banned snow-mobiles, outboard motors, and logging. President Carter signed the bill into law on 21 October 1978. The book Troubled Waters: The Fight for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (Proescholdt et al. 1996) discusses the role of Bud in advocacy and of Herb in science and in presenting expert evidence to congressional committees (Engstrom 2015) in relation to this fight. Bud’s (1996) book The Boundary Water Wilderness Ecosystem describes in detail the vegetation, ecology, history, and management of the BWCA. Herb helped Bud’s widow (Frances (‘Fran’); 1923-2013) and their children to finish the book and to prepare it for publication by the University of Minnesota Press (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’).\nAs an idea of the tensions that prevailed in northern Minnesota in the early 1970s about the BWCA and attempts to protect it, an effigy of the wilderness advocate Sigurd Olson (1899-1982) with the name of Bud Heinselman tacked to it was hung in Ely, northern Minnesota on 8 July 1971. Olson and Heinselman had feared that their efforts to expand the BWCA and to have it designated as a wilderness area would anger fellow Ely residents - and it certainly did!\nA national forest fire in May 1971, the Little Sioux fire, just outside the BWCA provided an opportunity to study the effects of a forest fire on the limnology of lakes within the burned area and on the forest ecosystem (Wright 1996). This was the first major area to be burnt since the US Forest Service initiated their fire-suppression programme in 1910. The results provided new insights into fire-lake interactions (e.g. Bradbury 1986; Bradbury et al. 1975; Grigal & McColl 1975; McColl & Grigal 1975; Tarapchak & Wright 1986; RF Wright 1976).\nHerb returned to Minnesotan fire history when his doctoral student James (‘Jim’) C Clark improved techniques for analysing and quantifying charcoal in lake sediments by using petrographic thin sections (Clark 1988a, 1990a) and provided an underlying theory for charcoal records (Clark 1988b). Clark studied three deep lakes with annually laminated sediments in the Itasca State Park in north-western Minnesota. Greater charcoal abundances, except after 1910 (when fire-suppression policies began) were during times of low lake-levels (Clark 1988c, 1989, 1990a). The charcoal records were not exactly the same for the three lakes, because different fires affected different catchments, as determined by fire scars on old pines dating back for several centuries (Wright 1992a). The charcoal record for the last 750 years at Deming Lake suggested maxima of fire frequency about every 90 years during the last few centuries of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (1700s, 1790s, 1880s) but a frequency about half that during the warm centuries preceding the ‘Little Ice Age’. Clark (1988c, 1990b) proposed a climatic periodicity based on the sunspot cycle of 22 years but that during an overall cool phase like the ‘Little Ice Age’ it took four cycles to build up enough dry fuel to sustain major fires compared to half that interval for a warm phase (Wright 1992a). These results suggest, for example, why fire suppression in the Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains since 1910 resulted in the great fuel accumulation that sustained the massive forest fires of 1988 and suggest how a combination of warm climate predicted for the 21st century and continuous fire suppression will result in even greater conflagrations in the future (Wright 1992a).\nHerb’s never-ending sense of adventure, love of wilderness areas, and fascination of geo-archaeological research resulted in another fire-history project, this time where Herb describes as “seven trips I made to the wonderful insect-infested wilderness of Labrador” (Farrand et al. 1990). This work resulted from an idea from the Arctic archaeologist Bill Fitzhugh that interactions between Native American and Inuit populations in Labrador were linked to the movements of reindeer (caribou) herds which depend on ground lichens such as Cladonia, Cladina, Cetrararia, and Stereocaulon as a major food resource. The initial hypothesis was that the extensive lichen cover was controlled by the occurrence and distribution of forest fires. Fire history could be reconstructed from charcoal preserved in Labrador lake sediments (Farrand et al. 1990). Although the initial hypothesis was intractable (Wright 1996), extensive palaeoecological investigations were made by several of Wright’s students on vegetational history (e.g. Lamb 1980, 1984, 1985), fire history (e.g. Foster 1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1985), landscape and peatland development (e.g. Foster & Glaser 1986; Foster & King 1984; Foster et al. 1983, 1988a, 1988b; Glaser & Foster 1984), lake history (e.g. Engstrom 1984; Engstrom & Hansen 1985; Engstrom & Wright 1984), limnology (e.g. Engstrom 1987), and climate change, glacial history, and deglaciation (e.g. King 1985). Herb’s fieldwork in the Labrador wilderness, along with sediment-coring attempts at Elk Lake have swelled the many legendary stories of adventures and misadventures of fieldwork with Herb (Engstrom 2015). In a characteristically modest way, Herb wrote about the Labrador project “I served as field assistant and devil’s advocate around the campfire” (Farrand et al. 1990).\nHerb also had a major influence on establishing detailed fire histories and long-term fire-ecological studies in Europe by asking Brigitta Ammann in Bern (Ammann 2016) “what is known about fire history in Switzerland?” This question initiated a Swiss National Science Foundation project (1993–95) which produced the first European charcoal–fire calibration study (Tinner et al. 1998) and provided new detailed insights into the fire ecology of central Europe (Tinner et al. 1999). In 1999, Herb convinced Willy Tinner, a PhD student of Brigitta Ammann to visit Feng Sheng Hu, a post-doctoral associate of Herb’s who had just been appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois. During his year in the USA, Willy organised sediment-coring expeditions in Alaska to reconstruct the Holocene fire history of the Copper River Basin. The 1999 field campaign only succeeded because of Herb’s great field experience, because after days of endless driving across the entire Copper River Basin, Herb immediately recognised Grizzly Lake as one of the most promising lakes in the area. Studies on the Grizzly Lake sediments (Tinner et al. 2006, 2015) have shown Herb’s choice was correct, as it so often was. When it came to site selection, Herb lived up to his initials – Hardly Ever Wrong!\nReconstructing fire history and fire frequency is now a major research activity in Holocene palaeoecology in the Americas, Europe, and elsewhere, due in part, to the pioneering work by Herb and his students and associates such as Bud Heinselman, Al Swain, Ed Cushing, David Foster, Jim Clark, Cathy Whitlock, Willy Tinner, and others.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright was as much at home in the field, even under difficult or sometimes atrocious conditions, as he was in his office in Pillsbury Hall (he often had its windows open even in winter!) or sitting by the wood fire in the living-room of his Hythe Street home in St Paul reading, listening to music, and editing manuscripts. Besides having the many skills of a Quaternary geologist, geomorphologist, and palaeoecologist to decipher stratigraphical sections, understand landforms, and interpret biotic changes, Herb had a passion for coring sediments in lakes and mires for subsequent pollen or other palaeoecological analyses (Wright 2010). It is unclear when and where Herb collected his first sediment cores, possibly as early as the mid-1950s in Iran or the Chuska Mountains in New Mexico but maybe in the late 1950s in Minnesota. He initially cored from the peaty margins of lakes in Iran or New Mexico or from the winter lake-ice in Minnesota. He perfected coring from open-water (Wright et al. 1965) using a variety of set-ups to allow operations from boats of various sizes and qualities, including canoes, home-made rafts, fallen logs, wooden frames, and even truck-tyre inner-tubes. He developed a much-improved 5-cm diameter stationary piston corer with an inner square rod (Wright 1967) and light-weight but strong magnesium-alloy drive rods (Wright 2010), as well as other types of corers (Wright 1980c).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and his son Dick with an early model of a Livingstone piston corer at Lake Zeribar, Iran, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright sediment-coring from an ingenious (and rather elaborate for Herb!) platform made of local poplar poles at Nilofar spring lake, Iran, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright attempting to sediment-core from a tyre inner-tube at Little Giant Basin, San Juan Mountains, Colorado, July 1959 (photo by Lou Maher)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and his double at the Geological Society of America annual meeting in Minneapolis, 2011 (provider of photo unknown)\n\n\nHe produced in conjunction with Jim Smith at a small machine-shop in St Paul hundreds of square-rod corers (including later a version suitable for coring into fibrous peat; Wright et al. 1984) and constructed over 4000 m of drive rods for colleagues around the world (Wright 2010). There seems to be a physical limit to how much sediment can be collected with this type of equipment, even with the help of chain-hoists and a drill-frame (Cushing & Wright 1965; Wright 1980c, 1991; Wright et al. 1965). Herb’s record is 40 m of core from Lake Zeribar collected in 1970 from a fringing peat mat (Wright 2010). This may be a world record.\nFieldwork with Herb could often turn into an adventure, even a serious adventure, or even a struggle for survival (Birks 2016; Birks & Birks 2016a; Engstrom 2015; Shay 2016). Minnesotan or Dakotan winters can be cold, even very cold, the high Peruvian Andes of 3000+ m (Wright 1986) have less oxygen than at sea-level, and northern boreal areas far from civilisation like the Yukon, Alaska, and Labrador can be insect-infested in the summer. Herb usually brought sub-optimal coring equipment and boats, and minimal food and overnight bivouac equipment with him, for example one snow-shoe is of limited use with deep soft snow at just above freezing point. His field vehicles were usually inadequate or had seen better days and they frequently ran out of petrol as mysteriously the fuel gauge usually did not function. Amongst his colleagues and students, there are masses of stories of adventures with Herb in the field (Almendinger and Jennings 2016; Baker 2016, Birks 2016; Birks & Birks 2016a; Engstrom 2015; McAndrews 2016; Shay 2016). Some of these have acquired legendary status. Herb particularly liked to sleep out ‘under the stars’ – he was quietly proud that he had slept out on all continents including Antarctica! Once in the Serra da Estrêla, eastern Portugal (Ammann 2016), Herb was sleeping out amongst granite blocks and tors. We had to leave early to get to Lisbon for a flight. We were about to leave in the dark when someone said “where is Herb?” I encouraged people to be quiet and listen carefully. His distinctive snore was soon heard, Herb was located, and the complete group left for Lisbon at 04:30!\nHerb emphasised that “ingenuity and resourcefulness in the field are particularly essential in coring operations, but it is important to understand the physical principles involved in how the equipment works and why it sometimes doesn’t work” (Wright 1991). Very many of his field colleagues would reiterate the importance of ingenuity and resourcefulness (and personal survival skills) when being in the field with Herb! It remains a total mystery why Herb would set off on coring expeditions so poorly prepared with old, barely functional equipment and inadequate boats, food, or clothing and with seemingly little concern for safety of himself or his colleagues (Engstrom 2015).\n\n\n\nTwo of Herb Wright’s many attributes were his ability to write clear and concise prose and his great patience to edit (and often re-write) other people’s manuscripts to make them as clear and as concise as possible (Amman 2016). In his 71 years of scientific publication from his first (Wright 1943) to his last (Ammann et al. 2014) publication, Herb’s papers are models of simple, concise, and elegant scientific writing. He encouraged all his students and colleagues to read, study, and follow Strunk and White’s (1979) The Elements of Style.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright writing and editing a manuscript about the vegetational history of Minnesota, 1995 (photo by Brigitta Ammann)\n\n\nHerb published over 200 scientific articles or book chapters, edited 15 books, and six Special Issues of journals (see Appendix and publication list). He edited and often rewrote thousands of manuscripts by colleagues from all over the world, modestly writing in his comments and edits in pencil. For example, he played a major part (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’) in the editing and illustrating of Palaeoecological Events During the Last 15,000 Years (Berglund et al. 1996), a compilation of Holocene events and important pollen-stratigraphical diagrams for almost all European countries. Herb (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’) commented about editing the magnum opus The Quaternary of the United States (Wright & Frey 1965) “I must have enjoyed doing this – perhaps it goes back to my days editing the high-school newsletter – so I agreed to edit the proceedings, which involved finding publishers around the country who would take on a symposium with supplementary related papers.”\nMany of the books he edited remain as major contributions to the literature of Quaternary research (e.g. Ruddiman & Wright 1987; Velichkoet al. 1984; Wright 1983b; Wright & Frey 1965; Wrightet al. 1993). Besides writing a large number of excellent primary research papers, Herb had a particular skill at synthesis and at writing many valuable and insightful review papers on a range of topics, starting with the Late Pleistocene climate of Europe: a review (Wright 1961a). Some of his most important reviews, as valuable today as they were when first published, include Wright (1966, 1968b, 1971b, 1974b, 1976c, 1976d, 1977b, 1981a, 1984c, 1987, 1989b), Watson and Wright (1980), and Yu and Wright (2001).\nHerb had a brilliant eye for design and for detail. In conjunction with draughtsman Richard (‘Dick’) Darling at the LRC in the 1960s and artist Rebne Karchefsky in the 1970s, they produced many outstanding illustrations of complex pollen-analytical data for publications (e.g. Birks 1976; Janssen 1967a, 1967c, 1984; Wright & Watts 1969; see Fægri 1973 for comments). A life-size portrait of Herb in the field, painted by Rebne, hangs on the walls of Pillsbury Hall in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Minnesota. It was painted as part of Herb’s retirement functions from his Regents’ Professorship in 1988.\n\n\n\nPortrait of Herb Wright in the Lost River Peatland, northern Minnesota painted by Rebne Karchefsky on the occasion of Herb’s official retirement.\n\n\nHerb’s generosity in editing (and often rewriting) manuscripts for his colleagues worldwide contributed greatly not only to the quality of the Quaternary literature but also invaluable scientific networking and international collaborations (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen 2’ and ‘Sils remarks’).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright was one of the most international Quaternary scientists of his generation, Soon after World War II, he travelled widely by train, bicycle, and motorbike in Europe and met many of the leading Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria (Wright 1957a, 1961b; Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’). Herb already had a nascent interest in lakes and pollen analysis acquired during his graduate days from Kirk Bryan Sr, so in the early 1950s he visited the major European Quaternary pollen laboratories in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and England. He was also active in geological and archaeological studies in Lebanon and Iraq. By 1955 Herb had thus established a strong communication network of Quaternary geologists, palaeoecologists, and archaeologists (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’. When the Minnesota pollen laboratory and the Limnological Research Center were founded in 1958 and 1959, respectively, it was natural that it was quickly populated by European palynologists and later palaeolimnologists. These visitors not only helped develop the pollen and LRC laboratories and build up their facilities, but also helped to train a large number of graduate students, many of whom are now leading Quaternary scientists in their respective fields. At least 18 countries were represented in the LRC from 1963 to 1990 whilst Herb was its director. The strong camaraderie within Herb’s LRC of the 1970s and 1980s lives on thanks to the friendships that developed in the LRC, at seminars in Herb’s house, and in the field (Björck 2016).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and the 2002 International Moor Excursion at Kråkenes, western Norway. This is a late-glacial site intensively studied by Hilary Birks and colleagues. Herb helped Hilary edit a Special Issue of Journal of Paleolimnology on the reconstruction of the late-glacial and early-Holocene aquatic ecosystems at Kråkenes Lake. Herb is sitting on the far left and Hilary is sitting at the far right in the front.\n\n\nIn his retirement, Herb was a regular visitor to Europe to visit laboratories and friends, explore new landscapes, and, of course, help core lakes and mires. In addition he was a regular participant on the annual Moor Excursion (Moorexkursion) (later also lakes) of the University of Bern instigated and organised by Gerhard Lang (1924-2016) in 1976, and continued by Brigitta Ammann from 1990 to 2006, and by Willy Tinner from 2007 to today. Between 1980 and 2007, Herb joined 15 of these excursions (Ammann 2016) and attended several international conferences and workshops in Europe. On the occasion of his 90th birthday, Herb wrote “I have felt like an academic uncle to her [Brigitta Ammann, Bern] students, whom I have helped with the englishification (John Birks would say americanization) of their manuscripts in preparation for publication” (Wright, unpublished note ‘Sils remarks’). He helped many colleagues core sediments in lakes and mires in Europe, as well as in Peru, Bolivia, Alaska, and Kenya. In his characteristically generous way, he played a large part in the fieldwork and/or in raising research money for several of these expeditions and in writing and editing the resulting manuscripts (e.g. Ahlberget al. 2000; Ammannet al. 2013; Birks & Wright 2000a, 2000b; Blyakharchuket al. 2004, 2007, 2008; Engstromet al. 2000; Stefanovaet al. 2006a, 2006b; Tinneret al. 2006, 2015; Verschurenet al. 2000; Westoveret al. 2006; Wrightet al. 2003).\nHerb was a truly international scientist with very extensive and effective trans-Atlantic scientific networks and collaborations that he maintained and extended for over 60 years. He was a great polymath in his approach to science and his research interests and achievements.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and friends at the Morteratsch Glacier, Engadine, Switzerland on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2007.

He published prolifically, researched globally, studied and synthesised many diverse topics, collaborated broadly, advised and influenced multiple graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, colleagues, and friends, and taught in many venues, but his greatest legacy was as a role model for all who knew him and worked with him. He was a remarkable and unique combination of genuine modesty, scientific curiosity, great generosity and kindness, quiet but effective leadership, a passionate love of adventure and wild places, intense loyalty, deep friendship, and strong devotion and service to his university, department, science, colleagues, students, friends, and family. By his example, he taught people to think independently and clearly, to design their projects carefully, to consider multiple working hypotheses, to read the literature both current and older, to attend seminars on topics not directly linked to one’s particular project, and to interact effectively. He was a master of scientific synthesis (Engstrom et al. 2016; Whitlock et al. 2016) and he could see links between seemingly disparate topics. He encouraged people to think logically and laterally, as he did and to discover new connections between different palaeoecological, palaeoclimatological, and ecological patterns and processes.\nHerb’s approach to science is elegantly summarised by Shane and Cushing (1991a) who wrote in the preface to the book Quaternary Landscapes that honoured Wright on the occasion of his formal retirement from the University of Minnesota.\n\n“He [Wright] has accomplished so much by carefully cultivating within the Limnological Research Center an atmosphere of cooperation, scholarly exchange, interdisciplinary research, and continuing international contacts.\nWright has modeled much of his teaching and research style on that of Kirk Bryan. For his students and colleagues this has meant friendship combined with independence of thought and work, wide-ranging discussions, stimulating seminars in Herb and Rhea’s home, and fantastic field trips with varied hardships. We have learned from him again and again that new technology such as isotopic dating techniques and computerized data manipulation provides only tools, not final answers; that scientific research is clearly and specifically founded in the most basic disciplines of orderly thought, constant questioning, and being sure of what one understands before moving toward speculation. In his leadership of the LRC, Herbert E. Wright, Jr., has shown us that careful research based on the desire for cooperation and discovery, and not tied to traditional scholarly boundaries, has both scientific and human value.”\n\nHerb also taught many of his collaborators the importance of dogged determinism, ingenuity, and perseverance in the field, particularly in the harsh conditions of a Minnesota winter or the trying conditions in wilderness areas with hordes of insects in the Yukon or Labrador. Through these hardships, strong bonds and friendships developed, many of which continue to the present (Björck 2016). Such long-lasting friendships are something that Herb must have been very proud of, as they symbolise so well the unique character of the LRC that he created, developed, and nurtured between 1963 and 1990. Herb really was a great giant in so many ways.\nHerb’s name will also live on through his invention of the Wright square-rod piston corer (Wright 1967). He also has a peak named after him, Wright Peak (1510 m) 0.9 km south of Sutley Peak in the Jones Mountains, Antarctica (73° 40’ S, 94° 32’ W). It was mapped by the University of Minnesota Jones Mountains Party of 1960-61 who named it for Wright who was an advisor to the Party. Wright visited Antarctica including Wright Peak in the 1961-62 season.\nThe obituaries and memorials by Almendinger and Jennings (2016), Anfinson (2016), Birks and Birks (2016b), Birks et al. (2016), Björck (2016), Engstrom et al. (2016), and Whitlock et al. (2016) discuss additional aspects of Herb’s legacies, leadership, and mentoring.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright was by far the most important mentor in my scientific career and my life (Birks 2014). My post-doctoral year in 1970 at the LRC with Herb and Ed Cushing was a career-changing event (Birks 2014). Many of my subsequent research activities and interests have their first roots in Room 218 in Pillsbury Hall, at seminars in Herb’s home, in the winter wilds of Minnesota or Wisconsin, in the summer heat of Florida, somewhere driving across the vast Northern Great Plains with Herb, Ed, and others, or in the St Elias Mountains of the Yukon in 1971 – numerical methods, quantitative environmental reconstructions, adventure botany and expeditions, modern pollen–vegetation relationships, linking vegetation history with palaeolimnology, detailed pollen morphology, quantitative pollen-stratigraphical analysis, diatoms and water chemistry, broad-scale vegetation changes and pollen mapping, tree migration patterns, etc. Through Herb and his wide network of research colleagues and regular stream of visitors to the LRC (e.g. Roel Janssen, Lou Maher, Bill Watts, Willem van Zeist), or fieldwork helpers (e.g. Dick Baker, Jock McAndrews, Tom Webb) I was able to meet and interact at an early stage in my career with many wonderful and stimulating colleagues, all linked by their close association and friendship with Herb. Herb was a very major influence on my life and my research and I miss him greatly. I owe so much to him.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright in Blekinge, 1979 (photo Björn E Berglund)\n\n\n\n\n\nI am very grateful to Jim Almendinger, Brigitta Ammann, Rick Battarbee, Björn E Berglund, Hilary Birks, Svante Björck, Platt Bradbury†, Jim Clark, Ed Cushing, Sylvie Desjardins, Dan Engstrom, Nancy Eyster-Smith, David Foster, Knut Fægri†, Magnus Fries†, Sheri Fritz, Paul Glaser, Eric Grimm, Barbara Hansen, Bud Heinselman†, Feng Sheng Hu, George Jacobson, Roel Janssen†, Carrie Jennings, George King, John Kingston†, Henry Lamb, Lou Maher, Allan Martini, Jock McAndrews, Bob Megard, Bobbi Megard, Noel Potter, Tom Shay, Vania Stefanova, Willy Tinner, Dirk Verschuren, Krystyna Wasylikowa, Red Watson, Bill Watts†, Tom Webb, Cathy Whitlock, Donna Whitney, Dick Wright, John Wright, Marianne Wright, Rhea Wright†, and Thierry Wright for much valuable information about Herb over many years, for pictures, and/or comments on an earlier version of this biography, and to Cathy Jenks for her meticulous editing.\n\n\n\nAaseng NE, Djupstrom RI.

    "text": "Herb Wright (1917–2015) was one of the world’s most distinguished Quaternary scientists. He was a great scientific polymath and an intellectual giant within the broad field of Quaternary research. He had an immense impact on many aspects of Quaternary science during the second half of the 20th century. He contributed greatly to our understanding of landscape history and environmental changes over the past 100,000 years in many parts of the world. He started with arid-region geomorphology and landscape evolution, which naturally shifted when he moved to Minnesota to glacial geology and climate history. The study of these topics led him to the study of vegetation development and environmental history and allowed him to define the timing and mechanisms of climate-driven vegetational shifts in North America during the last 18,000 years and to recognise the role of natural fire in the dynamics of northern forests. He was able to apply effectively these insights on fire history to wilderness conservation and landscape management. His endless curiosity expanded to cover many other aspects of palaeoecology including lake development and palaeolimnology, and the history and development of the vast patterned peatlands of the Northern Hemisphere. His work was concentrated in Minnesota, with its complex glacial, landscape, vegetational, and climatic history, but his broader vision led him to be involved in a major synthesis of global palaeoclimatology. Beyond Minnesota and the Great Lakes region, Herb studied a wide range of research questions elsewhere in North America, and in the Near East, Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Antarctica. His multidisciplinary approach and great powers of synthesis uncovered how the Earth’s landscapes and biota have been transformed at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in the past through the interactions between climate, flora, fauna, landform, and human activity.\nHerb, who died peacefully at his home in St Paul, Minnesota after a long illness on 12 November 2015, was born in Malden, Massachusetts on 13 September 1917. He studied at Harvard University, including his PhD on arid-region geomorphology and landscape evolution in New Mexico under the supervision of Kirk Bryan Sr. He completed his PhD thesis in 1943 whilst also training to be a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot during 1942–43. He flew many missions over Europe in 1944 and early 1945. In late 1945 he was appointed a teaching assistant at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island and moved in 1947 to be an assistant professor in the Department of Geology, University of Minnesota. He remained there for over 60 years and continually broadened his research interests and experiences and areas of study. He was appointed full professor in geology in 1959 and Regents’ Professor of Geology, Ecology, and Botany in 1974. The Limnological Research Center (LRC) was founded in 1959 and Herb was its director from 1963–90. The LRC quickly became the leading North American centre and power-house for palaeoecological, palaeolimnological, and neolimnological research. He always realised the importance of international communication and collaboration so a key policy of the LRC was to attract a large number of overseas visitors who provided inspiration, allowed a cross-fertilisation of ideas, and introduced multidisciplinary approaches to the LRC and its students. Between 1963 and 1990, visitors had come from at least 18 countries. During his long academic career, Herb supervised over 75 graduate and doctoral students, mentored countless other students, post-doctoral researchers, and research visitors from around the world, and influenced the careers of a very large number of students, friends, and colleagues. Very many are now leading scholars and making outstanding contributions to many different aspects of Quaternary research. Between 1943 and 2014, Herb published over 200 papers or monographs, and edited 15 influential books and six Special Issues of journals on a very wide range of topics within Quaternary science.\nThe major underlying theme of Herb’s scientific activities was the reconstruction of late-Quaternary landscape history at various spatial and temporal scales to explain the functioning of our present landscapes and ecosystems and how they might respond to climate change and human impact in the future. Thus he synthesised the vegetational and climatic history of Minnesota and adjacent states using a range of geological and palaeoecological approaches. With Miron ‘Bud’ Heinselman and others, Herb unravelled the key role of natural fire in the dynamics of coniferous forests. This led to Bud, Herb, and others to mount a successful campaign to save an extensive area of unlogged old-growth forest in northernmost Minnesota. Herb made major contributions to the understanding of the complex glacial history of the Great Lakes region and the control of the landscape on the development of peatlands and the origin of their spectacular surface patterns in the extensive peatlands of northern Minnesota and also in Labrador, Ireland, central Sweden, and northern Norway. He co-directed the multi-institutional Co-operative Holocene Mapping Project (COHMAP) with John Kutzbach, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein, and others in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In COHMAP, past climates were simulated by a global circulation model at 3000 year intervals for the last 18,000 years. Most importantly, attempts were made to validate the model simulation results against actual palaeoclimatic data. COHMAP resulted in a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research.\nAnother of Herb’s major contributions was the development of geo-archaeology starting in Lebanon and proceeding to Iraq, Iran, Kurdistan, and Turkey, and subsequently to Greece, Labrador, Peru, and Bolivia to study how the landscape and environment influenced the development of human societies and land-use practices.\nHerb was one of the first American scientists to realise that understanding environmental history required continuous sedimentary archives extending back in time: the most informative being lake sediments. A major but often unrealised contribution was Herb’s perfection of techniques for coring lake-sediments. This contribution has enabled the vast majority of palaeolimnological and palaeoecological research today. He had a passion for fieldwork and sediment coring, seeming to enjoy it most under difficult or near impossible winter conditions in Minnesota and the Dakotas, in wilderness areas such as Labrador, Alaska, and the Yukon, and in physically demanding regions such as the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes and the Siberian Altai. He loved fieldwork and he was coring lake sediments in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria just before his 90th birthday.\nHerb’s distinguished career was recognised by many honours and awards including honorary doctorates from Trinity College Dublin, Lund University, and University of Minnesota, membership of the National Academy of Sciences, a Distinguished Career Award from the American Quaternary Association, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Paleolimnological Association."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This biography attempts to describe and document the major contributions of Herb to Quaternary science and to outline his early life and education, career, family life, and retirement, as well as his influence on many students, colleagues, and friends. Before discussing Herb’s early life and his wide-ranging academic activities over 70 years, I summarise what to me are Herb’s ten most important contributions to Quaternary science. I discuss them in greater detail as separate topics within the large section on his ‘Scientific research activities and their impact’, before I conclude with a discussion of Herb’s lasting legacies and some personal comments.\nHerb had many research interests and made major contributions to a wide range of topics. His scientific contributions include the following.\n\nDeveloping geo-archaeological studies in the Near East (Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Kurdistan) and presenting important and challenging hypotheses linking early domestication and cultural events with climate change. In contrast to the long-standing hypothesis of environmental determinism in cultural history presented by Gordon Childe in the 1920s, Wright’s hypotheses were based on the results of detailed palaeoecological studies which he had initiated and which showed that climate in south-western Asia changed from dry to moist in the earliest Holocene. Childe had assumed the opposite, namely a moist-temperate period in the glacial period had changed to the semi-arid climate of today, thereby forcing animals, plants, and humans to congregate at oases where domestication had begun. Herb maintained a keen and active interest in multidisciplinary archaeological projects and worked on such projects later in, for example, southern Greece, Labrador, Peru, and Bolivia. These geo-archaeological studies ranging over 50 years of Herb’ s scientific career showed how the landscape and environment influenced, in different ways and in different settings, human development and societies.\nDeciphering the complex glacial history and resulting geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent states with their multiple ice-lakes, glacial surges, tunnel valleys, pro-glacial lakes and their shorelines, and ice-advances and ice-retreats. Herb also worked on many aspects of glacial geomorphology and landscape evolution elsewhere in areas as diverse as Alaska, the Yukon Territory, the Rockies, New Mexico, the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia, northern Greenland, Siberian Altai, the Near East, and Antarctica.\nSynthesising the late-Quaternary vegetation and climate history of Minnesota and adjacent states primarily based on the results of detailed pollen-analytical and plant-macrofossil studies. He also facilitated innovative studies on the vegetational and environmental history of Labrador, the Yukon Territory, Alaska, the south-eastern United States, New Mexico, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Iran, and Siberian Altai. He had a great passion for fieldwork and sediment coring (see 8 below).\nCreating a centre (the LRC) for North American palaeolimnology and neolimnology where critical questions on recent and prehistoric impact on lake ecosystems, past lake-levels, hydrological changes, patterns of lake ontogeny in recently deglaciated areas, and long-term lake development were studied intensively.\nCo-directing the multi-institutional COHMAP research consortium with John Kutzbach, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein, and others. The basic idea was to simulate past climates at 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, and 0 ka and to compare the climate-model simulations with available palaeoclimatic data. COHMAP led to a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research and Herb was a key contributor to this.\nUnderstanding the origin and maintenance of the spectacular surface patterns of northern Minnesotan peatlands, and subsequently, of patterned peatlands in Labrador, Ireland, central Sweden, and northern Norway.\nRecognising with Bud Heinselman the essential role of natural fires in determining the composition, structure, and dynamics of northern Minnesotan coniferous forests. Herb and colleagues pioneered the detailed reconstruction of Holocene fire histories from charcoal fragments preserved in annually laminated lake sediments. This early work showed the importance of fire in coniferous forest dynamics and had major implications for forest management and fire-suppression policies. Herb’s synthesis of landscape development, forest fires, and management was one of the earliest studies where palaeoecological results were used to propose management and conservation policies. Bud, Herb, and others campaigned tirelessly in the 1970s to save an extensive area of virgin, unlogged old-growth forest in northernmost Minnesota as a wilderness area where snow-mobiles, outboard motors, and logging would be prohibited. They succeeded in 1978 when President Jimmy Carter signed the relevant legislative bill.\nPerfecting field-craft and lake-sediment coring. Herb was as much at home in the field, even under difficult or sometimes atrocious conditions as he was in his departmental office or in his St. Paul home. He had a passion for coring sediments in lakes and he perfected coring from open-water using a variety of boats, canoes, home-made rafts, fallen logs, and even truck-tyre inner-tubes as platforms to core from. He continually improved lightweight piston corers and drive rods. Fieldwork with Herb could often turn into an adventure, or a serious adventure, or even a struggle to survive! He claimed never to remember any of these adventures, misadventures, or struggles! He loved all types of fieldwork, particularly in wild and remote areas.\nWriting clearly and concisely and editing manuscripts were two of Herb’s many skills and contributions to science. His publications are models of simple, concise, and elegant scientific writing. Herb commented after his 80th birthday that he must enjoy editing and thought that perhaps it went back to his days editing his high-school newsletter in the early 1930s.\nNetworking and international collaboration were an important part of Herb’s scientific modus operandi. Soon after World War II, Herb travelled widely in Europe and by the time he established the Pollen Laboratory in Minnesota in 1958, he had visited all the main European pollen laboratories and met the leading palynologists of the time. The LRC was a hotspot of international activity and collaboration in the 1960s–1980s thanks to Herb’s networking and collaborative skills. After his retirement, he continued to be a regular visitor to Europe to visit laboratories and friends, explore new landscapes, attend field excursions, and, of course, to help core sediments in lakes and mires in, for example, Norway, Ireland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Georgia, Siberian Altai, and on the Azores and Madeira, as well as in Kenya, Bolivia, Peru, and Alaska."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Herbert (‘Herb’) Edgar Wright Jr was born on 13 September 1917 in Malden, Massachusetts. His father, Herbert Edgar Wright Sr was an osteopath who died during the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1919–20. His mother, Annie Mabel Richardson (1878–1964), was a nurse. Herb had an elder sister, Helena (1915–2010). As a child Herb spent much time in the western suburbs of Boston with his favourite uncles and their families. He attended high school in Malden, where he enjoyed playing basketball and football. A high-school essay written on 14 November 1932 by the 15-year-old Herb on “Thoughts and Achievements” in College English 3 survives and provides details about Herb’s early life, and his thoughts, achievements, and ambitions. Herb’s father had been taught the clarinet by his brother-in-law and Herb Sr travelled around the eastern USA with a jazz band. He subsequently took up the new subject of osteopathy and he practiced his clarinet in the day and went to night-school in the evenings. Herb Jr records that he was a most active boy when young and had to be strapped into bed until he went to sleep. He started school when he was six and Herb wrote “I did not dislike school. I always took an interest in and tried to get all I could out of it”. He supplemented his meagre pocket money by cutting grass, selling papers, delivering and selling doughnuts made by his mother to some of his paper-round customers on Saturday mornings, and singing in local choirs. By 1932 Herb had saved enough to pay for a year at college. He was clearly a meticulous notekeeper, as he kept records of his finances, books read, movies, plays, lectures, etc. attended, marks received at school, and so on. In the concluding outlook in his essay, Herb wrote “If finances and other difficulties permit, I will continue to college, one of the best, I hope, and study as exclusively as I can in some subject that interests me. … Whenever I hear anyone speak about history from the fall of Rome to 1700, I am immediately interested. Why, I don’t know. Whenever anyone speaks of the creation of the world, or of ancient man before the first signs of cultivation, or of psychology, I am enthusiastic. Maybe I shall be a doctor or a college professor, for these two professions interest me a little, but whatever my occupation may be, it will take plenty of study and hard work. I am determined to go through college, though I haven’t planned on any certain one yet, although Harvard, Dartmouth, and West Point interest me. The selection, however, is not for me to decide now. I must wait until I finish my present course before I look too far ahead.”\nThe 15-year-old Herb’s ambition of studying at Harvard came to fruition as he graduated with a BA magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1939 and received his MA and PhD in geology from Harvard University in 1941 and 1943, respectively. His other ambition of becoming a college professor materialised in 1947. Herb started out as a Harvard biology student, with some thoughts of reading history or biology, following the footsteps of his sister who majored in biology at Radcliffe College, but after a trip to all the national parks west of the Mississippi River with their spectacular landscape, Herb’s interests shifted to geology, in particular arid-region geomorphology, landscapes, and their patterns and evolution (Herb Wright, pers. comm. 1971). He was greatly encouraged by Kirk Bryan Sr, a person who also greatly influenced the interests and careers of many students and colleagues. During his years at Harvard, Herb was Austin Teaching Fellow, laboratory assistant to Kirtley Mather, and field instructor for Kirk Bryan Sr (Schwartz 1972). He also helped to pay for his Harvard education by cutting grass, by driving tourists around downtown Boston, by working as a parking-lot attendant, by waiting at the student lunch club, and by other jobs at 50c an hour.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright in the 95th Bombardment Group of the Army Air Corps in 1944 (photo supplied by Jim Almendinger)\n\n\nWhen America entered World War II, Herb enlisted in 1942 as an air-cadet and became a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps. He finished writing his PhD thesis in boot camp in Nashville and whilst he was being trained to fly B-17 bombers at Geiger Field and Ephrata Air Bases, Washington, Rapid City Army Air Base, South Dakota, and Pyote, west Texas. He made two tours of combat duty based in Britain and flew 48 missions in 1944–1945 including runs over Germany during D-Day, over Berlin after D-Day, and at the Battle of the Bulge (Wright, unpublished note ‘1944 England’). He served as a pilot, command pilot, and group operations officer, reaching the rank of major (Schwartz 1972). He belonged to the 95th Bombardment Group stationed at RAF Horham near Bury St Edmonds in East Anglia. The 95th Group was the only Eighth Air Force group awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations and had the highest total claims of enemy aircraft (425) destroyed (Morris & Hawkins 2012). He was awarded the Air Medal six times, the Distinguished Flying Cross twice, and the Croix de Guerre from Charles de Gaulle. During his spare time at Horham, Herb visited by bicycle several classical Quaternary sites in the area including the famous interglacial site at Hoxne where he found Palaeolithic implements and Diss Mere, a lake that he was to revisit to core in 1979.\nWhen he was on leave and away from Horham for a few days, Herb often visited London with fellow airmen. There he attended concerts (e.g. Bach Mass in B Minor, Elgar The Dream of Gerontius), ballet, and plays; bought vinyl LPs of Beethoven’s piano concertos; ate and drank whisky and brandy at the Savoy Hotel; was fascinated by the soap-box orators at Hyde Park Corner; and spent exciting days in the library of the Geology Museum in Kensington where he lunched with its director. He also visited Oxford and Cambridge, learnt to play golf and bridge, and enjoyed English and French cuisine. His Quaternary field excursions, concerts in London, and visits to the Geology Museum are not listed in the official ‘Instructions for American Servicemen in Britain’ (War and Navy Departments 1942) which provides advice on the peculiarities of the “British, their country, and their ways” in an attempt to “lesson the culture shock for those embarking on their first trip to Great Britain and, for the most part, abroad”. Herb did not seem to suffer from any cultural shock whilst stationed in England!\nHerb considered his most exciting war-time moment came after his flight training when he was given a four-engine B-17 Flying Fortress nicknamed Lizzie to fly from Goose Bay in Labrador to England with a crew of 10 in the winter of early 1944. One engine had low oil pressure before taking off but Herb was allowed to set off across the Atlantic. Another engine failed halfway across the Atlantic. The plane began to lose power and altitude towards the Irish coast and Herb was forced to make an emergency landing at St Angelo airfield on the shores of Lough Erne near Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh. He landed too fast owing to ice that had accumulated on the wings and ran off the runway, coming to an abrupt halt with Lizzie’s right landing-gear intact but buried in mud and peat up to the top of the wheel and the left landing-gear buried up to the hub. The ball target, nose glass, and fixtures were damaged and three of Lizzie’s propellers were bent. Fortunately no-one was hurt but Herb confessed that he “felt a bit stupid after landing” (transcript of Wright’s crash report). He remarked later that to his amazement he simply signed a chit and was given a new plane (Paul Glazer, pers. comm. 2015). He also said that his landing at St Angelo may have been his first walk on a bog, many of which he visited professionally in years to come (George Jacobson, pers. comm. 2016).\nIn May 1945, Herb flew important aid-drops to The Netherlands. Sacks containing potatoes, flour, chocolate, etc. were dropped into marked fields bordered by cheering local residents. One young Dutch boy from near Arnhem collected some of the sacks – his name was C Roel Janssen (1930–2015) (Janssen, pers. comm. 2014). Janssen became a palynologist with a major research group in Utrecht, and worked with Herb in Minnesota 1962-1964 and later on short visits up to 1990.\nAfter his European tours flying B-17s, Herb returned to the USA and volunteered to fly in the Pacific theatre of war. He was sent to Sioux Falls Army Airfield, South Dakota for training with the new B-29s. In his spare time he borrowed a bicycle and explored the interesting Dakotan landscape. The 95th Bombardment Group was inactivated on 28 August 1945. Herb commented many years later that his favourite times flying were when he just had to put in hours in the air (for his pilot certification) because on those flights he could enjoy the clouds and the geomorphology of the landscapes beneath (George Jacobson, pers. comm. 2016).\nHerb’s first scientific paper (Wright 1943) was on the petrology, formation, and age of Cerro Colorado, an isolated non-basaltic volcano in central New Mexico. This was his first introduction to the geology and geomorphology of semi-arid landscapes. He continued in such landscapes for his PhD, which was on the Tertiary and Quaternary geology and geomorphology of the arid Lower Rio Puerco valley in western New Mexico (Wright 1946). It was during this work that he developed his strong and ever-lasting fascination with landscape history rather than only bedrock geology and geomorphological processes. He quickly realised, however, that landscape history could not be quantified without a chronology, and he puzzled about how to obtain such a chronology. He rapidly recognised the potential of lakes as they contained organic material that might be suitable not only for palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental investigations such as pollen analysis but also, perhaps in the future, for some form of relative or absolute dating. Herb continued this fascination and interest in the study of lakes and their sediments for over 60 years.\nHis PhD advisor and influential mentor, Kirk Bryan Sr (1888–1950), made a major impact on Herb’s career and research interests (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Herb acknowledges Kirk Bryan Sr (Wright 1946) for planning and guiding his Lower Rio Puerco study and gracefully suggests that “many of the ideas herewith presented were inspired by discussions with him”. Bryan was interested in many aspects of environmental history, especially climate change (Whittlesey 1951). His graduate students translated current papers by German scientists who were reconstructing ice-age conditions in Europe. In his early career as a faculty member at the University of Minnesota, Herb continued this tradition and distributed to colleagues translations of papers by, for example, Hans Poser (1907-1998), Julius Büdel (1903-1983) (Wright 1959; Wright & Alt 1959), and Carl Troll (1899-1975) (Wright 1958), mainly about the periglacial record in central Europe and periglacial processes globally. After visiting Europe in the late 1940s and meeting leading Quaternary scientists and geomorphologists in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Herb published a large review paper on the Late Pleistocene climate of Europe (Wright 1961a). Kirk Bryan was also interested in European vegetational and climatic history and late-glacial chronology and in the linkage between archaeology and geology. Both interests were keenly followed by Herb during his own research career. Another Kirk Bryan tradition that Herb followed was to hold weekly seminars in his home. For over 50 years, Herb held Wednesday-evening seminars on Quaternary glacial geology, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology, palaeolimnology, and neolimnology in the Wright home in St Anthony Park, St Paul McAndrews 2016). The seminars continue to this day in the same house, now hosted by Vania Stefanova.\nWhen Herb was appointed Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Minnesota in September 1947, he had already developed interests in lakes and their sediments, in geological applications to archaeology through his 1947 study near Beirut (see below), in landscape history, and in European vegetational and climatic history; interests that he would develop extensively during his long and distinguished academic career.\n\n\n\nAfter his war service in the Army Air Corps, Herb Wright was appointed in 1945 to be a teaching instructor at Brown College (now Brown University) (Providence, Rhode Island), then a liberal-arts college. He moved to the University of Minnesota in September 1947 as an Assistant Professor in the then Department of Geology (in 1962 it became the Department of Geology and Geophysics and is now the Department of Earth Sciences). The search procedure for this faculty position in 1947 consisted of a short informal interview with George A Thiel (1892-1979), the Chair of the Department. Thiel was attending a Geological Society of America meeting in New York. He telephoned Herb and asked him to take the train from Providence to New York so that they could meet. The ‘interview’ was in the lobby of Thiel’s hotel. At the end of their meeting, Thiel told Herb that he was hired – quite a contrast to today’s procedures of search committees, evaluation boards, trial lectures, counting publication citations, h-indices, etc. Once installed in Pillsbury Hall where the University of Minnesota’s Department of Geology is housed, Herb remained there for over 60 years. He was promoted to Associate Professor of Geology in 1951 and to Professor of Geology in 1959. He was also appointed Professor of Botany in 1965 and in Ecology in 1970 within the newly-formed Department of Ecology and Evolution and Behavioral Biology (now Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) at the University of Minnesota. He was named Regents’ Professor of Geology, Ecology, and Botany in 1974 and became Regents’ Professor Emeritus in 1988.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright, 1959 (photo supplied by Jim Almendinger)\n\n\nHerb had a large teaching load (Schwartz 1972) with courses or seminar series on structural geology, stratigraphy, and glaciology, as well as on his research interests such as physical geology and geomorphology, glacial geology, Quaternary environmental change, and landscape and climate history. He lectured to thousands and advised more than 75 graduate and PhD students during his 60+ years at the University of Minnesota. The lessons that Herb taught extended far beyond the lecture-hall or the field – they were lessons in modesty, conciseness, kindness, loyalty, devotion to sharing and understanding, and survival (see Memories of HEWright by Bob Baker).\nAfter his PhD work in New Mexico and his visits to Europe and the Near East in the early 1950s, Herb became interested in the potential of pollen analysis as a tool for reconstructing environmental change and landscape history. Thanks to a grant from the Hill Family Foundation in 1956, he was able to establish in 1958 a pollen laboratory in Minnesota. Herb invited experienced European pollen analysts and palaeoecologists to help in the development of the laboratory and to help in advising students. Magnus Fries (Sweden) was the first to come in 1958, followed by Saskia Jelgersma (The Netherlands: 1959–60), William A Watts (Ireland: 1961 and later), Willem van Zeist (The Netherlands: 1960–61), Roel Janssen (The Netherlands: 1962–64 and later), Maj-Britt Florin (Sweden: 1964–65), Krystyna Wasylikova (Poland: 1964–65), Kazimierz Wasylik (Poland: 1965), Elizabeth Haworth (UK: 1967), Johanna Grüger (Germany: 1968–69), Eberhard Grüger (Germany: 1968–69), Hilary Birks (UK: 1970), H John B Birks (UK: 1970–71 and later), and, in later years, Jan Janssens (Belgium and Canada: 1980–89), Richard W Battarbee (UK: 1981–82), Svante Björck (Sweden: 1981–82 and later), and Ingemar Renberg (Sweden: 1991). With a separate grant from the Hill Family Foundation, the Limnological Research Center (LRC) was established in 1959. The pollen laboratory was incorporated within the LRC in 1963 when Herb became the LRC Director. The LRC rapidly developed expertise not only in palaeoecology but also in palaeolimnology and neolimnology with faculty members such as Joe Shapiro, Robert (‘Bob’) O Megard, Alan Brook, and Eville Gorham. The LRC attracted many foreign visitors for short (1–3 month) visits from Canada, UK, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovenia, France, Spain, and Japan. Its multi-national flavour was supplemented by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from Canada, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, China, and Japan. The LRC under Herb’s leadership became a major international centre for palaeoecological, palaeolimnological, and neolimnological research. Herb retired from being LRC director in 1990.\nThroughout his professional career, Herb conducted major and demanding research projects not only in Minnesota but also across North America from Florida via New Mexico to Alaska, as well as in the Yukon, Labrador, and Mexico. Abroad he worked in Norway, Sweden, Russia, Siberia, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Azores, Madeira, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Peru, Bolivia, and Antarctica. He made extended academic visits to Russia, China, Australia, and several European countries. He published more than 200 international scientific papers, edited 21 books or Special Issues of journals, and supervised at least 36 PhD dissertations and 38 MSc or MA theses in the University of Minnesota’s Departments of Geology, Ecology, and Botany, and its Center for Ancient Studies. He was involved as an invaluable advisor for countless more graduate students and post-doctoral visitors. Many of his students and post-doctoral visitors are now leading scholars and are making outstanding contributions to many different aspects of Quaternary research as well as to teaching, supervision, and mentoring.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright formally ‘retired’ from his Regents’ Professorship in 1988 at the mandatory (at that time) age of 70 and from being director of the Limnological Research Center in 1990. He continued to teach and advise graduate students for many years thereafter. In his retirement he participated in numerous sediment-coring expeditions to remote parts of the globe, including the high Peruvian Andes, Glacier Bay in Alaska, the Azores, the Bulgarian Pirin mountains, the Caucasus of Georgia, and the Siberian Altai. He was visiting Hilary and John Birks in Bergen in December 1988 when he decided to stay an extra day or two in Norway before returning to the USA. Fortunately, he was able to change his reservation that was for PanAm flight 103 on 21 December 1988, the flight that was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, to a later flight with a different carrier. Until about 2010, Herb was actively engaged in science with writing and editing. He travelled to Guadalajara in Mexico to receive on 16 December 2009 his Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Paleolimnology Association (Wright 2010). His last publication (Ammann et al. 2014) formed part of a festschrift volume in honour of Hilary Birks who worked with Herb on various projects since her post-doctoral year in the LRC in 1970.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright met his wife-to-be Rhea Jane Hahn (1921–1988) in church choirs at Harvard University and Radcliffe College in the early 1940s. They married on 27 June 1943 at the Moody Field Post Chapel, Valdosta, Georgia. Herb was then an air-cadet in the Army Air Corps and Rhea was a nursing student at Yale College of Nursing. They spent their honeymoon at Sea Island, Georgia followed by a short residence at Sebring, Florida. They had six sons (Richard (1944–), Peter (1948–1955), John (1950–), Rex (1953–1988), Andy (1955–), and Jeffrey (1959–)).\nHerb and his family enjoyed many cross-country skiing trips, sometimes with their neighbours in St Anthony Park, St Paul. His sons often accompanied Herb on field expeditions to core in, for example, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, Labrador, the Yukon, Minnesota, New Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. For many summers, Herb and Rhea rented a rustic cabin with no electricity on an island in Lake Minnetonka just west of the Twin Cities. Several families, some of whom were faculty at the University of Minnesota, would often have supper together in the summer evenings and enjoy the idyllic tranquillity of Lake Minnetonka.\nHerb greatly loved classical music (see below) and he regularly attended concerts of the Minnesota Orchestra (formerly known as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra), the St Paul Chamber Orchestra, and Music in the Park. Besides the music of Schubert and Brahms, he was very attracted to Faure’s Requiem. Herb once told Brigitta Ammann (pers. comm. 2015) that he would like Faure’s Requiem at his funeral but said “just too bad that I will not be able to hear it”. At his Memorial Service on 5 December 2015, the music was by Bach, Handel, Marcello, and Beethoven. He avidly read liberal newspapers and regularly listened to Minnesota public radio. Rhea also loved music and she played piano, flute, and recorder and taught piano in the 1950s–1960s. Rhea and Herb hosted local recorder groups in their home.\nHerb and Rhea were an important part of the ‘Hythe Street Regulars’ for over 50 years and the many visitors to Herb’s LRC quickly experienced the wonderful camaraderie of the ‘Regulars’ from Kemper Kirkpatrick, Kim and Ann Munholland, John and Judy Howe, Dick and Finette Magnuson, Bobbi and Bob Megard, and all their respective children. They made visitors from far afield feel very much at home, even in the midst of a fierce Twin Cities January night. Herb and Rhea became ‘second parents’ to many young children of their friends and colleagues.\n\n\n\nÅsa Björck listening captivated to her big favourite Herb, reading an exciting story, with Rhea Wright as an attentive spectator, Twin Cities, 1982 (photo by Svante Björck)\n\n\nHerb died peacefully at his St Anthony Park home in St Paul on 12 November 2015 after a long illness. Rhea predeceased him on 21 January 1988 as did sons Peter and Rex. His sons Richard (‘Dick’), John, Andy, and Jeffrey survive him along with his grandchildren Patrick, Christopher, Thierry, and Theora, and great-grandson Adrian, as do daughter-in-law Sylvie (widow of Rex), Vibeke, Christa, and Maria, partners of Dick, John, and Jeffrey, respectively, and Marianne Wright. For the last 14 years of his life, Herb was lovingly cared for by his dear friend and colleague Ivanka (‘Vania’) Stefanova."

    "text": "Classical music was a very important part of Herb’s life (Wright, unpublished letter 27 May 2001). He described himself as an “addict of classical music”. He met his wife-to-be Rhea in choirs at Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. Herb had sung in two local church choirs as a schoolboy – one because the choir-master organised a basketball team and the other because a small salary was paid for participating. By his own admission, Herb was not a good singer but he learnt to read music and carry a tune. In his first year at Harvard College, he took a course on music appreciation and leant all the proper forms and styles. He spent long hours in the listening rooms trying to memorise themes and dissect the musical structure. The professor was so deeply involved in the beginnings of music in Medieval times that the course never reached the 19th century! Herb’s fascination with music tempted him to volunteer as an usher at the monthly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the College auditorium. Herb also enlisted in the Harvard Glee Club along with the legendary Leonard Bernstein. Herb also joined the university chorus and he sang in the chorus for a recording of Beethoven’s Symphony no.9 (‘Choral Symphony’) by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After moving to Minnesota, Herb again joined the university chorus and again sang the Choral Symphony but this time with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the Minnesota Orchestra). He regularly attended its concerts over 60 years with season tickets for seats near the front on the right-hand side, exactly where he was an usher back in the early 1930s in Boston. He usually bought four or six season tickets and sold or gave them to friends or colleagues. He also keenly supported the St Paul Chamber Orchestra and was a friend of the Music in the Park series, now renamed The Schubert Club who dedicated their concert on 25 September 2016 to Herb, twelve days after his birthday. Herb Herb enjoyed listening to radio programmes that included interviews with soloists or directors commenting about the music they would be performing in the Twin Cities. He greatly enjoyed the articulate, informal, and talented English musician and scholar Christopher Hogwood talking as Artistic Director of the St Paul Chamber Orchestra to explain the connections between pieces that he would direct at the next concert. One such example of ingenious Hogwood programming that Herb greatly enjoyed was Tippett’s Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, Holst’s St Paul’s Suite Op.29, number 2, and A Fugal Concerto Op.40, number 2, Corelli’s Concerto Grosso in F Op.6, number 2 and Trio Sonata Opus 3, number 4, and Bach’s Fugue in B minor on a Theme of Corelli (BWV579).\nHerb’s musical tastes focused on the late 18th and the 19th centuries with the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, and to a lesser extent Haydn. He was fascinated by Schubert’s Eight (‘Unfinished’) Symphony. His wife’s tastes, as a recorder player, were more in the late 17th and early 18th centuries of the Baroque period. I once bought her and Herb an LP of the Academy of Ancient Music’s superb and stylistically unique rendering (1981) of Pachelbel’s Canon and Gigue directed by Christopher Hogwood. Rhea loved it so much that she almost wore the LP out. It was played at the wedding of their son Rex to Sylvie."

    "text": "During his long and distinguished scientific career, Herb Wright had many research interests and made major contributions to at least ten topics. The overarching aim of Herb’s activities was to reconstruct the late-Quaternary history of individual areas and ultimately of the world and to use these reconstructions to improve our understanding of the present and the future (Shane & Cushing 1991a; Wright 1973a). To Herb the term history had a broad meaning to include geological, geomorphological, climatic, biotic, and anthropological change over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales (Shane & Cushing 1991a). Herb (Wright 1973a) discussed Quaternary science and public service in modern society with all its environmental problems. Herb concluded “many aspects of the projects in which one might become involved are interesting scientific problems themselves, apart from their application to an environmental crisis. A combination of intellectual stimulation and emotional satisfaction is hard to beat. I recommend it as a modest ingredient in an academic diet.” Clearly for Herb it was a very important diet that sustained him as a Quaternary scientist and active environmentalist for 70 years.\nChapters in Quaternary Landscapes (Shane & Cushing 1991b) review six of the ten topics discussed below – origins of food production and archaeology (Watson 1991), Quaternary glacial history and stratigraphy (Mangerud 1991), peat growth (Clymo 1991), palaeoecology (Ritchie 1991), palaeolimnology (Battarbee 1991), and climate and vegetational change (Kutzbach & Webb 1991). These papers were presented at a symposium in Minneapolis in May 1988 to honour Herb on the occasion of his formal retirement as Regents’ Professor. The additional four topics discussed below concern Herb’s contributions and legacies to fire history, conservation, and landscape management; field-craft and sediment coring; writing and editing; and scientific networking and collaboration.\n\n\nBefore being hired by the University of Minnesota, Herb Wright was a teaching instructor at Brown University (Providence, Rhode Island) (1945–1947) where he worked on glacial geology. During the summer of 1947, he went to coastal Lebanon to make a sedimentary and geomorphological study of the Ksar Akil Upper Palaeolithic rock shelter near Beirut (Wright 1951), as part of a Boston College–Fordham University excavation at the suggestion of Kirk Bryan Sr and Hallam Movius (1907-1987). The rock shelter is now recognised as an important site that encompasses Mousterian and Upper Palaeolithic industries in a 23-metre thick deposit. Herb wrote “I shudder to think that my field area was in West Beirut itself, where cemented coastal sand dunes and intercalated soils and marine shell beds suggested a story of environmental change” (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Initially Herb travelled each day by tram (street-car) from his lodgings at the American University of Beirut. He later lived with Jesuit archaeologists at the archaeological site. They were looked after by an Armenian cook who maintained an excellent field camp. Herb borrowed an old car and explored the marine terraces and other geomorphological features of the Lebanese coast and became fascinated by the environmental history and landscapes of the Near East (Wright 1996; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’).\nThe archaeological contacts that resulted from Herb’s 1947 Lebanon expedition led to him being engaged by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago as a field geologist to work with Robert J Braidwood (1907–2003) and others on the ‘hilly flanks’ of Iraq, in particular Iraqi Kurdistan. Herb worked there in 1951 when he had a leave of absence from the University of Minnesota for three months during which he held a Wenner-Gren Fellowship (Schwartz 1972). He determined the extent of erosion of the prehistoric site of Jarmo (the earliest city in the world) on top of a river bluff that had been eroded away. He also worked at Karim Shahir and the middle Palaeolithic site at Barda Balka (Wright 1952). There were inevitable adventures and misadventures on this 1951 expedition – vehicle malfunctions and other problems, running out of fuel, getting stuck in mud, illness, unusual food, etc. (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wadis’, ‘Another adventure with mudholes and empty gas tanks’, ‘Iraq March 14 1951, ‘Iraq Jan 30 1951’, ’51-22 Jarmo’).\n\nFieldwork problems in Iraq, 1951 (photos by Allan Martini)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese geo-archaeological studies and those of his in Lebanon in 1947 were some of the first geological interpretations of Near Eastern prehistoric sites and they served as a major stimulus for Herb’s interests in the role of climate in the development of civilisation, especially the question of the origins of agriculture; interests that he had acquired from his Harvard mentor Kirk Bryan Sr. When Herb saw the Kurdistan landscape (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’), he began to consider its history and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of a larger area than the Jarmo site. Braidwood’s main aim was to find evidence relevant to the causes of the transition from food gathering to food production and the origin of village life. Bob Braidwood therefore encouraged Herb to explore and travel throughout Kurdistan and the mountains of Iraq, Iran, and Turkey in search of former glaciers and relic landforms that might provide hints about past climate. These studies and travels coincided with the establishment of the US National Science Foundation and Braidwood developed the idea that any understanding of the origins of agriculture required a multi-disciplinary approach involving archaeology, prehistory, and the natural sciences (geology, botany, zoology). Radiocarbon dating was also developing rapidly at this time under the direction of WF Libby (1908-1980), a colleague of Braidwood at the University of Chicago, thereby providing a means to develop an absolute chronology of past events (Wright 1957a, 1996). This opened up many new research possibilities in prehistoric archaeology, palaeoenvironmental studies, and landscape history (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). In 1954–55 Herb – sponsored by a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Wenner-Gren Fellowship, the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute (Schwartz 1972), and its Iraq–Jarmo Project – began trying to decipher the environmental history of Iraqi Kurdistan on the basis of landforms and correlations and teleconnections with glacial events in Europe. He drove a Land Rover and trailer with his wife Rhea and family of three small boys from London to Baghdad by way of Interlaken, Graz, Belgrade, Istanbul, Damascus, and the pipeline road across the desert of Jordan (Wright 1996) and spent an adventurous year exploring Kurdistan and living in primitive Kurdish villages (Wright 1996; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). He published a detailed glacial history of the area (Wright 1961b) but the chronology was uncertain and its relevance to the origin of agriculture remained uncertain (Wright 1960, 1996).\n\n\n\nLake Zeribar, Zagros Mountains, Iran. Field-camp by the lake, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\nThe Iraqi revolution in 1957 precluded further work in Iraq, so activities shifted across the mountains into Iranian Kurdistan in 1960 (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Herb’s frustration with undated landforms, along with his developing interest in lakes and their sediments, resulted in him coring many small lakes in western Iran including Lake Zeribar north-west of Kermenshah (which he also cored in 1960, 1963, and 1970) in the Zagros Mountains and other sites later in eastern Turkey and Israel. He had several more field seasons in the Near East as part of Braidwood’s investigations of early villages and the origin of agriculture. With Krystyna Wasylikowa (Krakow), Willem van Zeist (Groningen), Bob Megard (Minnesota), and others Wright masterminded in the early 1960s a detailed multidisciplinary study of the Zeribar sediments, involving pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, cladocera, mollusca, geochemistry, stable isotopes, and radiocarbon dating (Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008). Herb and his colleagues found a reasonable correlation between the time when the regional vegetation changed from steppe to forest and the time when plants were first domesticated, and Herb subsequently developed several new hypotheses to link climatic change and cultural events (Wright 1968a, 1976a, 1977a; Wright & Thorpe 2003). These replaced the earlier ideas of Childe (1929) on the early domestication of plants and animals in the Near East.\nFollowing this early work in the Near East, Herb maintained a keen interest in multidisciplinary archaeological projects (Anfinson 2016). He worked with the archaeologist WA McDonald in the University of Minnesota Messenia Expedition on late Bronze Age environments at Osmanaga Lagoon in the Peloponnese of southern Greece (Wright 1984a; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). He assisted Tom Shay in his detailed palaeoecological analysis of the Itasca bison kill site (Shay 1971). Herb also initiated detailed palaeoenvironmental studies (pollen, charcoal, geochemistry) in the remote wilderness of Labrador in response to a suggestion of Bill Fitzhugh (Smithsonian Institute) that the interactions of prehistoric Native American and Inuit populations in that area were related to the movement of reindeer herds which depended on ground lichens as a major food resource (Farrand et al. 1990; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). It was hypothesised that the extent of lichen cover was a function of the occurrence and distribution of forest fires and that fire history could be reconstructed from charcoal fragments preserved in lake sediments. Herb and colleagues survived seven field seasons in Labrador: some of these involved having to live off ‘cream of Cladonia soup’ (made by Nancy Eyster-Smith) for a time and being forgotten by a bush-pilot and having Dan Engstrom and Henry Lamb hike and raft to Port Hope Simpson on the Labrador coast to get help (Wright 1996). Although the original archaeological premise was shown to be intractable (Farrand et al. 1990), this archaeological question inspired extensive and detailed palaeoecological studies on several aspects of the landscape history of Labrador (Wright 1985) (see also sections 6 and 7 below).\nHerb’s most recent involvement with prehistoric archaeology was in the central Andes of Peru and Bolivia in response to questions raised by Kent Flannery (University of Michigan) about the environmental setting for the first hunting cultures in the highlands and by John Rick’s (Stanford University) excavations of cave sites that were apparently occupied contemporaneously with the nearby wasting glaciers (Farrand et al. 1990; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen’). Expansion and then retreat of the still-existing glaciers during the last 1000-2000 years suggested major climatic changes. Archaeological surveys in areas close to the upper limit of cultivation indicated population shifts and other cultural changes prior to the Incan period (Seltzer & Hastorf 1990; Wright 1980a, 1986; Wright et al. 1989). Herb spent six summers in the Andes working with John Rick, Geoff Seltzer, Christine Hastdorf, Julie Stein, and Carrie Jennings, starting in Peru but shifting to Bolivia because of dangerous Peruvian guerrilla activities in the study areas. Other archaeological contributions by Herb include Wright (1974a, 2000, 2006) and Anfinson and Wright (1990) (see Anfinson 2016).\nIn 1989 Herb received an Award from the Archaeological Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (Farrand et al. 1990), and wrote when discussing his role as a geologist and palaeoecologist in multidisciplinary projects with archaeologists that “the director of an interdisciplinary project must be willing to spend the time and resources in facilitating peripheral adventures, such as providing a vehicle and perhaps a guide, arranging permission with appropriate authorities, and tolerating an absence from the site for extended periods. Beyond that, however, the director must also be willing to spend the time and intellectual effort to understand the purpose of such explorations and the research methods, and to learn about the results in detail, for it is the director’s ultimate responsibility to integrate these results into a synthesis that should be the ultimate goal for the project. It has been my good fortune to be associated with archaeologists who have made these commitments in time and energy, and I believe that their success in the profession is in some part a result of such an approach. What small scientific contributions I have made to archaeology can be attributed in part to their willingness to allow their resident geologist and paleoecologist to roam so widely, and in part to their interest in incorporating the results of such peregrinations into their archaeological thinking.” (Farrand et al. 1990).\n\n\n\nSoon after joining the Department of Geology, University of Minnesota in 1947, Herb Wright was urged by the Director of the Minnesota Geological survey to begin a revision of the complex glacial geology and Quaternary history of Minnesota with several ice-lobes criss-crossing the state of ‘ten thousand lakes’ (Schwartz 1972). This topic had largely been ignored since the pioneering studies by NH Winchell (1839–1914), Warren Upham (1850–1934), Frank Leveretta (1859–1943), Frederick B Sardeson (1866–1958), and WH Emmons (1876–1948) in the early part of the 20th century. Herb started work in Minnesota and the Great Lakes region in the summer of 1948. Herb’s studies and those of his graduate students such as Charles L Matsch (1930–2014), Edward J Cushing, Jim Zumberge, Stan Chernicoff, Barry Goldstein, Howard Mooers, Al Schneider, and Carrie Patterson (Jennings) helped decipher and understand the complex glacial history and resulting geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent areas with multiple ice-lobes, glacial surges, tunnel valleys, drumlins, eskers, pro-glacial lakes and their shore-lines, complex ice-advances and ice-retreats, inland sand-dunes, and periods of erosion and deposition in the Minnesota and Mississippi River valley as a result of glacial recession. These studies by Herb and his students and colleagues resulted in a large number of important primary publications. Herb provided two masterly reviews (Wright 1972a, 1972b) on the Quaternary history and physiography of Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand for list of papers\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor papers on the glacial geology and geomorphology of Minnesota and adjacent areas by Herb Wright and his students and colleagues.\nBjörck S.

He was a regular participant on the Friends of the Pleistocene field trips. His first such trip was in May 1947 to the Finger Lakes areas of central New York. Many well-known American Quaternary scientists were on this trip including Hugh M Raup (1901-1995), Kirk Bryan Sr, Richard F Flint (1901-1976), and Richard P Goldthwait (1911-1992) (Friends of Pleistocene Geology 1947).\nHerb’s keen sense of adventure and his constant drive for interdisciplinary studies led to a month-long expedition in 1971 to the Klutlan Glacier in the wilderness of the St Elias Mountains of the Yukon (Wright 1980b, 1996). The impressively surging Klutlan Glacier with large areas of spruce forest growing on dead-ice was a possible modern analogue for the late-glacial landscape of Minnesota (Florin & Wright 1969; Wright 1976b, 1981a; Wright & Stefanova 2004). Studies were made on the flora and vegetation (Birks 1980a), soils (Jacobson & Birks 1980), modern pollen and recent vegetational history (Birks 1980b), limnology (Whiteside et al. 1980), lake development (Bradbury & Whiteside 1980), glacial geology (Driscoll 1976, 1980a, 1980b), geomorphology (Watson 1980), and hydrology (Driscoll 1980b) of the Klutlan Glacier and its ice-cored moraines. The 1971 Klutlan party consisted of Herb and a glacial geologist (Fletcher Driscoll), a plant ecologist (John Birks), two limnologists (John Platt Bradbury, Melbourne (‘Mel’) C Whiteside), and a philosopher of science (Richard (‘Red’) A Watson) whose task was to observe how these people applied different approaches to a common problem during a month in the wilderness (Wright 1996). Fletcher Driscoll and George Jacobson returned in 1972 to complete hydrological and ice-wastage measurements and soil-development studies. George and Fletcher were not at all thrilled that the provisions Herb had arranged for their month-long stay on the Klutlan Glacier in 1972 consisted entirely of a large bag of rice and a large bag of raisins (George Jacobson pers. comm. 2016)! Besides various adventures and exciting and challenging camp-fire discussions, the 1971 and 1972 Klutlan studies stimulated more detailed limnological, palaeolimnological, and hydrological studies on neoglacial moraines in the oceanic Glacier Bay, Alaska by Dan Engstrom, Sheri Fritz, and Jim Almendinger (Engstrom & Fritz 2006; Engstrom et al. 2000; Fritz et al. 2004) often with Herb, Geoff Seltzer (1969-2005), and others as devoted field helpers.\n\n\n\nThe establishment of the pollen laboratory at the University of Minnesota in 1958 with a grant from the Hill Family Foundation in St Paul was an important stage in Herb Wright’s scientific activities (Schwartz 1972; Almendinger and Jennings 2016). During his doctoral studies in New Mexico in the early 1940s, he had already developed an interest in lakes and their sediments as a potential source of data for inferring relative chronologies and vegetational as well as environmental and climatic history. His research in the Near East and Minnesota in the early 1950s continued to inspire and stimulate this interest.\nHerb’s initial awareness of the potential of pollen analysis as a tool in reconstructing landscape history, past climates, and relative chronologies probably came from his Harvard mentor Kirk Bryan Sr who closely followed the European literature on pollen analysis and climate history in the 1940s and 1950s. Herb’s interest was stimulated further by the publication of Edward S Deevey’s (1914-1988) masterly review of Pleistocene biogeography (Deevey 1949) and by his own travels around Europe in the early 1950s. Besides meeting many European Quaternary geologists, Herb also visited the main pollen-analytical centres in Europe and met Max Welten (1904-1984) in Bern, Franz Firbas (1902-1964) in Göttingen, Johannes (Johs) Iversen (1904-1972) and Svend Th Andersen (1926-2009) in Copenhagen, Tage Nilsson (1905-1986) in Lund, Gunnar Erdtman (1897-1973) in Stockholm, Knut Fægri (1909-2001) in Bergen, and Harry Godwin (1901-1985) in Cambridge.\nHerb recalled (Wright, unpublished note ‘Sils Remarks’) that whilst a graduate student and after he discovered lakes and their sediments were suitable for pollen analysis he gained “a background in plant identification and ecology. I took to a course offered by the great plant taxonomist ML Fernald (1873-1950), editor of the authoritative Gray’s New Manual of Botany. But I was soon discouraged by the requirement to draw in Indian ink the leaves of mostly tropical plants mounted on herbarium sheets and to memorize the attributes of tropical plant families. This seemed not to be a productive way to approach vegetation history”. So as Herb admitted (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen), “Not being an avid microscopist, I called upon experienced European specialists to establish a pollen laboratory at Minnesota and to help in advising students.” On the advice of Johs Iversen, Herb invited Magnus Fries (1917-1987) from Uppsala to come and develop the laboratory and to train a group of talented graduate students (Wright 1994). Fries worked in Minnesota during 1958, established the pollen laboratory, started building up its modern pollen reference collections, trained graduate students such as Edward (‘Ed’) J Cushing, Louis (‘Lou’) J Maher Jr, Robert (‘Bob’) C Bright (1928-1995), John (‘Jock’) McAndrews, Thomas C Winter (1936-2010), and Harvey L Patten, and did a detailed palynological study of Weber Lake in north-east Minnesota (Fries 1962).\nFries was followed by Saskia (‘Kiek’) Jelgersma (1929-2012), Willem van Zeist, and C Roel Janssen (1930-2015) (all from The Netherlands), William (‘Bill’) Watts from Ireland (1930-2010), Krystyna Wasylikova and Kazimierz (‘Kazik’) Wasylik (1925-2000) from Poland, Johanna and Eberhard Grüger from Germany, Hilary and H John B Birks from the UK, and Svante Björck from Sweden. All these visitors contributed significantly to reconstructing floristic, vegetational, and climatic history of Minnesota and neighbouring states and, in the case of Bill Watts, of many other states in the eastern, central, and south-eastern USA.\nThe publications by Winter (1962), Fries (1962), Cushing (1963), McAndrews (1966), and Wright and co-authors (Wright et al. 1963) presented the first detailed modern pollen diagrams from different ecological regions of Minnesota. Many of these studies revealed the dynamic behaviour of the prairie-forest ecotone in the Holocene. In his first visit to Minnesota in 1961, Bill Watts developed stratigraphic quantitative plant-macrofossil analysis that built on the pioneering palynological study at Kirchner Marsh (Winter 1961, 1962; Wright et al. 1963) to produce one of the first ever quantitative plant-macrofossil studies (Watts & Winter 1966). Watts made similar studies in northern Minnesota, South Dakota, and Nebraska (Watts & Bright 1968; Watts & Wright 1966; Wright & Watts 1969) before embarking on studies on the vegetational history of the south-eastern states (e.g. Grimm et al. 1993; Hansen et al. 2001; Watts 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1980a, 1980b, 1983; Watts & Hansen 1987, 1994; Watts & Stuiver 1980; Watts et al. 1992), central Appalachia and the New Jersey coastal plain (Watts 1979), Bermuda (Watts & Hansen 1986), and Mexico (Watts & Bradbury 1982) (see Chapter 6 in Watts 2008).\nBill Watts visited the LRC and worked with Herb for over 40 years. Besides providing an unrivalled amount of new information about the late-Quaternary floristic, vegetational, and environmental history of the Great Lakes region, south-east USA, and Appalachia, Bill pursued many other careers (Watts 2008). He was a lecturer and subsequently a professor at Trinity College Dublin, as well as Trinity’s Provost from 1981 to 1991. He was an outstanding Provost and he initiated significant modernisation and expansion of research and teaching within the College. He was also active in Irish nature conservation, Dublin hospital management, President of the Royal Irish Academy 1980–82, and chaired various Irish charitable trusts. Despite all these duties, Bill remained active in research, particularly the vegetation history of Florida and Italy (Watts 2008).\nBill also developed an interest in the Pacific North West and co-supervised Cathy Whitlock in her work in Washington and Oregon (Barnosky 1984, 1985a, 1985b; Barnosky et al. 1987a; Whitlock 1992; Whitlock & Bartlein 1997; Leopold et al. 2016). Cathy also spent time at the LRC when she worked on the pollen stratigraphy of Elk Lake (Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993) and of the Red Lake peatlands (Janssens et al. 1992).\n\n\n\nCathy Whitlock and Herb Wright with a core of surface-mud from a small lake in Yellowstone National Park, 1987 (photo by Dan Engstrom)\n\n\nOne of Herb’s MSc students Richard (‘Dick’) G Baker learnt macrofossils from Bill Watts (Baker 1965) and went on to do detailed and important macrofossil work in Yellowstone (Baker 1976) and in the Midwest (Baker et al. 1989, 1996, 2002, 2009).\nSeveral of Herb’s early doctoral students spent a year working in some of the major European palynological laboratories (e.g. Ed Cushing in Copenhagen, Lou Maher in Cambridge, Jock McAndrews in Groningen, Bob Bright in Uppsala) allowing them to benefit directly from leading European researchers.\nThe activities of the pollen laboratory were not confined to Minnesota and adjacent states. Willem van Zeist, Krystyna Wasylikova, Kazik Wasylik, and Bob Megard studied pollen, plant macrofossils, diatoms, and cladocerans, respectively, in cores from Lake Zeribar in Iran (e.g. Megard 1967; Snyder et al. 2001; van Zeist 1967; van Zeist & Bottema 1977; van Zeist & Wright 1963; Wasylikowa 1967, 2008; Wasylikowa & Witkowski 2008; Wasylikowa et al. 2006). The geochemistry and stable oxygen isotopes were also studied later (Stevens et al. 2001, 2008; Wright 1966). These investigations plus those on Charales oospores, molluscs, and charred plant macrofossils made Lake Zeribar one of the most palaeoecologically intensively studied lakes in the world with multiproxy records extending to about 48,000 years ago (Wasylikowa et al. 2008). To provide a factual basis for the interpretation of the Zeribar pollen stratigraphy, Wright, McAndrews, and van Zeist (1967) did an extensive survey of modern vegetation and its pollen rain in western Iran. This study showed the importance of studying modern pollen assemblages as an aid to the interpretation of fossil assemblages. The Lake Zeribar studies initiated by Herb in 1960 (Megard B 2016; Megard RO 2016) have provided unique insights into environmental and climate history relevant to our understanding of the origins of agriculture in the Near East (Wright & Thorpe 2003).\nDespite all this activity on Minnesotan and Iranian vegetational and environmental history, Herb maintained an interest in the arid landscapes of the American South-West where he had done his doctoral research. The Chuska Mountains in north-western New Mexico are dotted with many small lakes so Herb started to explore these (Wright 1964; Wright & Bent 1968). Whilst the sediments of Minnesotan lakes are most effectively cored through ice in the winter or early spring, the Chuska Mountains are inaccessible in winter so Herb used primitive wooden coring platforms and rafts made of truck-type inner-tubes for summer coring. Cores from Dead Man Lake in the Chuska Mountains yielded a long Wisconsin-stage record (Bent & Wright 1963; Wright et al. 1973b). Detailed quantitative pollen-morphological studies (Hansen & Cushing 1973) showed that Pinus flexilis (limber pine) was present in the past, although today it grows farther north in the Rockies.\nAs well as this work on late-Quaternary vegetational history, pioneering studies in Herb’s pollen laboratory on modern local-scale pollen deposition in relation to vegetation (Janssen 1966, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c, 1973, 1984), differential pollen preservation and redeposited pollen (Cushing 1964, 1967a), delimitation of pollen assemblage zones and their mapping in space and time (Cushing 1967b), using pollen ratios to identify elevational limits of different conifer genera using modern pollen assemblages (Maher 1963), experimenting with different pollen sums (Wright & Patten 1963), exploiting transects of pollen sites across natural climate gradients to explore past vegetation and climate dynamics (McAndrews 1966; see also Nelson & Hu 2008), and developing integrated pollen, plant macrofossil, and vegetation studies in the Rockies (Bright 1966) were all important conceptual and methodological contributions to Quaternary palynology and palaeoecology as a whole. Within about 10 years Herb’s pollen laboratory had become the leading centre for Quaternary pollen analysis in North America and one of the leading centres in the world with a strongly international flavour. Pollen analysis and vegetational history continued to be a major part of Herb’s scientific activities until his retirement (and beyond), through new visitors from Germany, England, and Sweden and returning visitors from the Netherlands, Ireland, and England, and via the many outstanding collaborators and graduate students who worked on a wide range of projects involving pollen analysis, often linked to specific ecological or Quaternary geological problems.\nA major mainstay in the pollen laboratory was Barbara Hansen who worked with Herb and various colleagues on pollen analyses from a wide range of geographical areas for many years. Within North America, Barbara has worked in North Dakota (Hansen & Wright 1987), Kentucky (Wrightet al. 1966), Minnesota (Janssenset al. 1992), New England (Fosteret al. 2006; Parshall et al. 2003; Oswald et al. 2007), Labrador (Engstrom & Hansen 1985), Hudson Bay Lowlands (Glaseret al. 2004a), Washington (Hansen & Easterbrook 1974), Alaska (Engstrom et al. 1990; Hansen & Engstrom 1996), Florida (Grimm et al. 1993; Hansen 2006; Hansenet al. 2001; Wattset al. 1992), and Bermuda (Watts & Hansen 1986). Further afield, Barbara has done major pollen-analytical studies in Guatemala (Johnsonet al. 2001), and Peru and Ecuador (Bush & Hansen 2005; Hansen 1995a, 2003; Hansen & Rodbell 1995; Hansenet al. 1984, 1994; Wrightet al. 1989), and even in Mongolia (Fowellet al. 2003). She has perfected conifer stomata analysis in North America (Hansen 1995b; Hansenet al. 1996) and resolved several critical pollen morphological problems (Hansen & Cushing 1973; Hansen & Engstrom 1985). Barbara’s friends and colleagues, especially Herb, were delighted when in 2001 she was awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award by the University of Minnesota.\n\n\n\nWith the ever-increasing interdisciplinary nature of many of Herb Wright’s research activities involving lake sediments and the importance of lakes in the Minnesotan landscape, it was natural that in 1959 a Limnological Research Center (LRC) was established within the University of Minnesota with the support of a separate grant from St Paul’s Hill Family Foundation. Herb became the director of the LRC in 1963 and the pollen laboratory was incorporated into the LRC within the Department of Geology and Geophysics. As he had done in the early days of the pollen laboratory, Herb enticed several leading European palaeolimnologists to come and work in the LRC, including Maj-Britt Florin (1905-1993) and Ingemar Renberg from Sweden and Elizabeth Haworth and Richard (‘Rick’) W Battarbee from England. Herb also attracted many talented post-doctoral palaeolimnologists including Bob Megard, John Platt Bradbury (1936-2005), John C Kingston (1949-2004), Richard (‘Dick’) B Brugam, Mel Whiteside, and Thomas Crisman and recruited several outstanding graduate students (e.g. Sherilyn C Fritz, Daniel R Engstrom) to work on different palaeolimnological projects (Wright 1994). A wide range of such projects quickly developed (e.g. Bright 1968; Winter & Wright 1977; Wright 1966, 1981b, 1992a, 2010). The original emphasis was on diatoms (e.g. Bradbury 1975), cladocerans (e.g. Megard 1964, 1967; Quade 1969), and ostracods, but broadened as new techniques were developed and refined such as pigment analysis, stable-isotope analyses, sediment geochemistry, mineralogy, and magnetics. Studies on lake-level changes and palaeohydrological modelling of prairie lakes (e.g. JE Almendinger 1990, 1993; Digerfeldt et al. 1992; Winter & Wright 1977) and on lake-sedimentation processes (Almquist-Jacobson et al. 1992) were also pursued.\nImportant studies on lake eutrophication were made in the 1970s (Birks et al. 1976; Bradbury 1975; Bradbury & Megard 1972; Bradbury & Waddington 1973; Brugam 1979; Gorham & Sanger 1976), often involving a multiproxy approach with pollen and diatom analyses and sediment geochemistry. Palaeolimnological techniques such as diatom analysis, pigment analysis, or geochemistry were applied to several ‘classic’ Herb Wright sites such as Kirchner Marsh (Brugam 1980; Florin 1970; Florin & Wright 1969; Sanger & Gorham 1972) and Pickerel Lake (Dean & Schwalb 2000; Haworth 1972).\nElk Lake in north-west Minnesota became a site for much LRC palaeolimnological research (Anderson et al. 1993; Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Birks et al. 1976; Bradbury & Dean 1993; Bradbury and Dieterich-Rurup 1993; Bradbury et al. 1993; Brugam 1993; Dean et al. 1984; Megard et al. 1993; Sanger & Hay 1993; Stark 1976; Whitlock et al. 1993; Wright 1993; Zeeb & Smol 1993). The first study (Stark 1976) involved collecting seven sediment cores and 25 surface samples from a transect across the lake. The surface samples were used to establish the ostracod, molluscan, and chironomid assemblages at different water depths. Stark (1976) determined the fossil composition for 14-25 levels in each of the seven cores to reconstruct the trophic sequence with respect to the sediment type (Wright 2010). The environmental settings for the trophic histories were inferred from skeletal pollen diagrams prepared for each core. This demanding multi-proxy study was all done by Donna Stark for her doctoral study. A second study at Elk Lake (Birks et al. 1976) concerned recent lake responses to catchment changes. The study involved three lakes, two badly polluted (Sallie Lake and St Clair Lake) and one control (Elk Lake) and pollen, plant macrofossil, cladoceran, and diatom analyses (Birks 2016). The third and major palaeolimnological study at Elk Lake involved (after several unsuccessful coring attempts) a 22-m-long series of cores from a continuously laminated sequence of post-glacial (10,400 years) sediment recovered from 29.6 m water depth in the deepest part of Elk Lake in 1978 and 1982. These cores were intensively studied by several investigators for their pollen (Bartlein & Whitlock 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993), diatoms (Bradbury & Dietrich-Rurup 1993; Brugam 1993), chrysophyte cysts (Zeeb & Smol 1993), charcoal (Clark 1993; Whitlock et al. 1993), geochemistry (Dean 1993; Dean & Megard 1993; Dean et al. 1993), mineralogy (Anderson 1993; Dean 1993), stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (Dean & Stuiver 1993), pigments (Sanger & Hay 1993), and sedimentation (Dean & Megard 1993; Nuhfer et al. 1993; Sprowl 1993). The results of this remarkable study were published as 20 papers in a Geological Society of American Special Paper edited by J Platt Bradbury and Walter E Dean (Bradbury & Dean 1993). Herb had been involved in many attempts at obtaining continuous cores from the deep hole of Elk Lake from 1967 to 1982 and he had many more failures than successes! 1970 produced a successful continuous core but on our return to Minneapolis the trailer containing the cores became detached and the cores were badly damaged and unusable. Herb was mortified and silent, but in a day or two he was talking quietly about a possible return to Elk Lake! He had to wait until 1971 for that.\n\nElk Lake, Itasca State Park, north-west Minnesota, in July 1970 (left) and coring its sediments from the ice in March 1970 (right) (photos by John Birks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her 1970 stay at the LRC, Hilary Birks examined the relationship between modern assemblages of seeds and fruits in surface sediments and aquatic vegetation in over 50 Minnesotan lakes across the state (Birks 1973). This innovative study provided basic information on macrofossil representation today as a guide for interpreting fossil assemblages. Bob Bright examined modern diatom assemblages in relation to water chemistry in Minnesotan lakes (Bright 1968). This study was extended by Dick Brugam (Brugam 1993).\nAnother innovative study was initiated by Rick Battarbee whilst he was a visiting researcher at the LRC in 1981-82. This involved lakes in the Northern Great Plains along gradients of lake-water salinity and conductivity (Fritz 1990; Fritz & Battarbee 1988; Fritz et al. 1991, 1993; Radle et al. 1989). Work on the history of the Northern Great Plains has now been extended by Dan Engstrom, Sheri Fritz, Eric Grimm, Jim Clark, Emi Ito, Kate Laird, Brian Cumming, Will Hobbs, and others using diatoms, pollen, charcoal, ostracods, isotope ratios of ostracod carapaces, and models of groundwater flow (e.g. Barnosky et al. 1987b; Brown et al. 2005; Clark et al. 2001, 2002; Dean & Schwalb 2000; Grimm 2011; Grimm et al. 2011; Hobbs et al. 2011; Laird et al. 1996; Valero-Garces et al. 1997). Related multi-disciplinary work has been done in the Nebraska Sand Hills (e.g. Schmieder et al. 2011, 2012), an area that fascinated Herb since his early work there with Bill Watts (Watts & Wright 1966), in the Yellowstone National Park (Engstrom et al. 1991), and in the Eastern Prairie Peninsula in Illinois (Nelson et al. 2006).\nWhilst visiting Hilary and John Birks in Cambridge, UK, in 1979 Herb asked if there were any nearby lakes that needed coring. Herb, John Birks, and several Cambridge researchers including Henry Lamb, Pete Coxon, Brian Huntley, and Mary Edwards visited Diss Mere in Norfolk and raised a 13 m core from the lake centre. When we got to the lake, Herb realised that he had been there before, in 1944 when he was based near Bury St Edmonds, and he had wondered then how this perfectly circular basin had formed. The sediment core collected in May 1979 and a second deeper core collected in 1980, provided the material for detailed pollen analysis by Sylvia M Peglar and for detailed diatom analysis by Sherilyn C Fritz that formed major parts of their two doctoral theses, one in Bergen and one in Minnesota. This work led to important publications about lake ontogeny, the relationship between lake-catchment and land-use, the likely cause of the elm decline in the mid Holocene, changing land-use, and the formation of annually laminated sediments in Diss Mere (Fritz 1989; Peglar 1993a, 1993b; Peglar & Birks 1993; Peglar et al. 1984, 1989). None of this work would ever have been done if Herb had not asked if there was a nearby lake to core!\nThe LRC quickly developed expertise in modern limnology, phytoplankton ecology, lake restoration management, and biomanipulations of lakes through its Associate Director Joseph Shapiro and affiliated faculty members including Bob Megard, Eville Gorham, Alan Brook, and Hans-Olaf Pfannkuch. The Wednesday-evening seminar series at Herb’s home was extended to include one quarter devoted to limnology and one to palaeoecology in order to promote the interdisciplinary heart of the LRC and for many years these were active interactions among the LRC palaeoecological and neolimnological graduate students and post-graduate fellows, including limnologists such as Val Smith, Edward Swain, Michael Lynch, Bruce Forsberg, and David Wright. When Herb retired as Director of the LRC, Kerry Kelts (1947-2001) was appointed Director until 2000 (Johnson & Talbot 2002). Emi Ito is now the LRC Director and she has established excellent facilities for stable-isotope analyses in palaeolimnology, which were close to Wright’s interests (Hu et al. 1977, 1999; Stevens et al. 2006). The LRC hosts the LacCore – the national lacustrine core facility – a major research facility for state-of-the-art handling and logging of lake-sediment cores.\n\n\n\nMuch of Herb Wright’s research was at a local (e.g. Lake Zeribar) or regional (e.g. Minnesota) scale (Wright 1996) but in 1977 he and Ed Cushing with John E Kutzbach and Thompson (‘Tom’) Webb III from the University of Wisconsin and Brown University, respectively, initiated a group called COHMAP (Climates of the Holocene – Mapping Based on Pollen Data). The aim was to attempt for the terrestrial realm what the CLIMAP project (Climate: Mapping, Analysis, and Prediction; a multi-institutional consortium led by John Imbrie (1925-2016), James D Hays, Nicholas J Shackleton (1937–2006) and Andrew McIntyre) had done so successfully in the marine realm (CLIMAP Project Members 1976, 1981; Gates 1976). CLIMAP had, for the first time, combined results of general circulation models of past climate with palaeoceanographic data (primarily foraminifera). COHMAP quickly became global in its research extent and in the climate proxies it considered (terrestrial pollen, lake-levels, marine plankton, pack-rat middens). It changed its name to the Co-operative Holocene Mapping Project after incorporating researchers from the UK, Canada, and New Zealand and from other universities in the USA. Masterminded by John Kutzbach, Herb, Tom Webb, Pat Bartlein and many others (Wright et al. 1993), COHMAP focused on simulating past climates at 18,000, 15,000, 12,000, 9000, 6000, 3000, and 0 years ago and comparing the model simulations with the available palaeoclimate data (COHMAP Members 1988; Wright & Bartlein 1993).\nCOHMAP’s modelling experiment results show how orbitally induced changes in insolation and changes in surface boundary conditions affect regional climates and hence the observed broad-scale changes in vegetation, marine plankton, and hydrology (COHMAP Members 1988). COHMAP was a major turning point in Holocene climate research for several reasons. First, it used what were then state-of-the-art general circulation models to simulate palaeoclimate under specified boundary conditions. Second, it resulted in detailed compilations and syntheses of palaeoclimate proxy data that were then used in data-model comparisons. Third, it considered the global climate as a whole and revealed the strong regional interconnections between different components of the Earth’s climate system. Fourth, it revealed the remarkable spatial and temporal variation in circulation patterns and climate at 3000-year intervals during the Holocene (Wright 1996; Wright et al. 1993).\nHerb played a major part in COHMAP because of his deep curiosity about the Earth’s climate system, his extensive knowledge of late-Quaternary history, his willingness to share data, his synthesis with Neil Roberts of the vegetation, lake-level, and climate histories of the Near East (Roberts & Wright 1993), his lead editorship of the large COHMAP volume (Wright et al. 1993; Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’), and in making one of its first detailed data-model comparisons for 18,000 years ago for North America using the COHMAP climate model simulations and extensive palaeoclimatic and geological data (Kutzbach & Wright 1985).\nCOHMAP was a major paradigm shift in Holocene climate research (Birks 2008) and Herb was an important contributor to this paradigm shift, or in his words part of the “breakthroughs in Ice-Age history” (Wright 1996). COHMAP was a model of multi-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration with its yearly meetings that brought together all the principal investigators, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows from the many laboratories involved to discuss and advance ideas about late-Quaternary palaeoclimate. Herb greatly enjoyed and valued this approach to collaborative research involving early-, mid-, and late-career scientists, all with a common scientific interest.\nBecause of the highly dynamic nature of Holocene climatic and biotic changes (Hu et al. 1999), Herb wrote several important critiques and reviews of chronostratigraphic classification in which he argued that formal chronostratigraphic procedures may not be appropriate or useful when one has, as in the Holocene, an absolute chronology (Watson & Wright 1980; Wright 1976c, 1981c). He also wrote valuable reviews about the Quaternary in general (Wright 1989a), interglacial pollen records (Wright 1972c), palaeoclimates (Wright 1992b, 1995), vegetation history and climate change (Wright 1981a), and Holocene chronologies (Wright et al. 2004).\n\n\n\nMinnesota has more peat than any other US state except Alaska. The northern Minnesotan peatlands exhibit spectacular surface patterns with forested islands, ovoid islands, water tracks, sedge lawns, raised bogs, flarks, and other surface features. These patterns are most clearly seen when viewed from the air (see, for example, plates 1-16 in Wright et al. 1992). They reflect the complex interactions between vegetation and local environment. In the early 1950s, Donald B Lawrence (1911-1996), a plant ecologist at the University of Minnesota, showed Herb Wright some aerial photographs of the Red Lake peatland taken by a Naval Reserve pilot on training flights. Herb, who was fascinated by aerial photographs and landforms at a range of spatial scales, was immediately struck by the vegetation patterns but was puzzled by their nature and possible origin. Don Lawrence and Herb set out a set of stakes in one patterned area to test the hypothesis that the peat ridges resulted from soil or peat creep, possibly triggered by frost activity. After a year the stakes were removed but no significant movement was detected (Heinselman 1992).\n\n\n\nMyrtle Lake (north-east Minnesota) peatland surface patterns of string ‘flarks’ running from a mineral-rich area, October 1970 (photo by John Birks)\n\n\nMiron (‘Bud’) L Heinselman (1920-1993) began his doctoral research on the ecology and growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) on the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands east of the prairies of the Red River Valley in northern Minnesota. He attended several of Herb’s courses on glacial geology and geomorphology and Herb joined Bud’s doctoral committee. They became life-long friends with many common interests, most particularly conservation and management (see the next section of Fire History). Herb encouraged widening Bud’s doctoral research topic to include peatland hydrology and the striking vegetational patterns that are so characteristic of these peatlands. Heinselman (1963) concluded that the peatland patterns were examples of a whole suite of peatland surface-patterns that occur in different forms around the entire circum-boreal region (e.g. Sjörs 1959, 1961).\nSome of Herb’s students (e.g. Griffin 1975, 1977) and colleagues (e.g. Janssen 1967b, 1968, 1984) began studies on the modern vegetation and pollen assemblages and on the peat and pollen stratigraphy of these northern Minnesotan peatlands. Heinselman (1970) completed investigations on the history of Myrtle Lake and the development of the vast peatlands north-west of the lake. As a result of these and other studies, Bud and Herb became actively aware that pulp-wood logging, Christmas-tree harvesting, and the use of Muskeg tractors (bombardiers) were having an impact on these fragile ecosystems. The great impacts of possible drainage, road construction, and peat mining were also in their minds (Heinselman 1992). In 1962 the Myrtle Lake peatland was designated a research natural area—the Lake Agassiz Peatlands National Area—and in 1964 a Registered National Natural Landmark. However, its official registration was never accomplished because of local opposition. Then in 1975 the Minnesota gas company (Minnegasco) wanted to lease 300,000 acres of the Red Lake peatland for peat mining. That proposal prompted the first major efforts to protect some of Minnesota’s most distinctive patterned peatlands. Fortunately, the Minnegasco threat never materialised but it resulted in the extensive and detailed studies in the Minnesota Peat Program. These studies included flora, fauna, vegetation, hydrology, ecology, palaeoecology, history, peatland development, and human influences and they were published together in the book The Patterned Peatlands of Minnesota edited by Herb Wright, Barbara A Coffin, and Norman E Aaseng (Wright et al. 1992). The threats to these peatlands and all the research focused on these peatlands stimulated concern and interest in designating certain peatlands for protection against future disturbance. On 4 June 1991 Governor Arne Carlson signed into law the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991 that dedicated all 146,239 acres of state-owned lands in the core areas of the 18 peatlands as scientific and natural areas (Aaseng & Djupstrom 1992).\nHerb’s fascination with these Minnesotan patterned peatlands and the origin and development of the patterns led to major projects on peatland ecology and palaeoecology not only in Minnesota but also elsewhere in eastern North America and in the Hudson Bay Lowlands with Jan Janssens (e.g. Janssens et al. 1992), Paul H Glaser (e.g. Glaser 1987a, 1987b, 1992; Glaser & Janssens 1986; Glaser et al. 1981, 1990, 2004b; Wright & Glaser 1983), George A King, and David R Foster. Besides research on patterned bog ecology and development in Labrador (Foster & Glaser 1986; Foster & King 1984; Foster et al. 1983, 1988a; Glaser & Foster 1984), David Foster, Herb, and associates also studied patterned mire development in Sweden (Almquist-Jacobson & Foster 1995; Foster & Fritz 1987; Foster & Jacobson 1990; Foster & Wright 1990; Foster et al. 1988b). Between them, Herb, David Foster, and Paul Glaser also studied aspects of mire development in Switzerland (Ammann et al. 2013), northern Norway, and Ireland.\n\n\n\nBesides peatland ecology, Bud Heinselman intensively researched the role of natural fire in northern conifer-dominated (Pinus spp., Picea spp.) forests, particularly in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) of north-eastern Minnesota’s Superior National Forest. He had canoed this wilderness area since he was a boy. Between 1960 and 1974, Bud and Albert (‘Al’) M Swain, a doctoral student of Ed Cushing, canoed through parts of BWCA in the summers and took incremental cores for tree-ring counting from pine trees, mainly Pinus resinosa (red pine) to reconstruct the stand age-structure and fire history in different parts of the BWCA. Bud located and mapped the remaining virgin, unlogged old-growth forests dating back to 1595 within the million acres of the BWCA. An obvious question was could the natural fire history be extended further back in time by analysing charcoal particles in lake sediments, ideally with annual laminae (varves) to provide an absolute chronology for the charcoal peaks? Herb, Bud, and Ed Cushing set out not only to find a suitable lake with annual laminae but also to work out how to recover undisturbed laminae from the near-surface sediment without having the laminated structure disrupted by escaping gas bubbles (ebullition). The 31-metre deep Lake of the Clouds in Lake County, north-east Minnesota on the border with Canada was selected and cored because of its laminated sediments. It was one of the first sites whose uppermost sediments were sampled by an effective freeze-corer improvised on site by Herb, Bud, Ed Cushing, Al Swain, Noel Potter, and Mel Whiteside (see Wright 1980c for details of freeze-corers and ‘frozen fingers’).\nAlan J Craig constructed a complete Holocene pollen diagram (Craig 1972) for Lake of the Clouds and Al Swain (Swain 1973; see also Swain 1980) reconstructed a detailed record of charcoal and hence fire history for the last 1000 years, showing an average fire frequency of approximately 60-70 years with a range of 20-100 years. It was clear from Bud and Al Swain’s extensive field observations and Al’s (1973) palaeoecological studies that “fire largely determined the composition and structure of the pre-settlement vegetation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as the vegetation mosaic on the landscape and the habitat patterns for wildlife. It also influenced nutrient cycles, and energy pathways, and helped maintain the diversity, productivity, and long-term stability of the ecosystem. Thus the whole ecosystem was fire-dependent. […] To restore the natural ecosystem of the Canoe Area fire should soon be reintroduced through a program of prescribed fires and monitored lightning fires. Failing this, major unnatural, perhaps unpredictable, changes in the ecosystem will occur.” (Heinselman 1973).\nTo highlight fire history and ecology, and the use of fire in management, Herb and Bud organised a symposium and field excursion devoted to the ecological role of fire in natural conifer forests of western and northern America at the August 1972 meetings of the Ecological Society of America and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. The symposium papers were published in the journal Quaternary Research rather than in a more strictly ecological journal to emphasise the basically historical nature of the role of fire in natural forest ecosystems (Heinselman & Wright 1973; Wright & Heinselman 1973).\nWright (1974b) provided an important and wide-ranging critical review of landscape development, forest fires, and wilderness management in which he argued that fire may provide the long-term stability needed to preserve certain conifer-dominated forest ecosystems. It is one of the earliest papers where palaeoecological studies were used to suggest management and conservation policies. His approach of integrating long-term palaeoecological data into contemporary and future landscape management has been elegantly extended by Whitlock et al. (1991) to the Yellowstone National Park.\nIn the 1970s Herb and Bud campaigned tirelessly to save the BWCA as a wilderness area. Bud and others founded the Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness in 1976 to push for new federal legislation to protect the BWCA. Their efforts largely succeeded in October 1978 when Congress passed the BWCA Wilderness Bill and expanded the area by 50,000 acres and banned snow-mobiles, outboard motors, and logging. President Carter signed the bill into law on 21 October 1978. The book Troubled Waters: The Fight for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (Proescholdt et al. 1996) discusses the role of Bud in advocacy and of Herb in science and in presenting expert evidence to congressional committees (Engstrom 2015) in relation to this fight. Bud’s (1996) book The Boundary Water Wilderness Ecosystem describes in detail the vegetation, ecology, history, and management of the BWCA. Herb helped Bud’s widow (Frances (‘Fran’); 1923-2013) and their children to finish the book and to prepare it for publication by the University of Minnesota Press (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’).\nAs an idea of the tensions that prevailed in northern Minnesota in the early 1970s about the BWCA and attempts to protect it, an effigy of the wilderness advocate Sigurd Olson (1899-1982) with the name of Bud Heinselman tacked to it was hung in Ely, northern Minnesota on 8 July 1971. Olson and Heinselman had feared that their efforts to expand the BWCA and to have it designated as a wilderness area would anger fellow Ely residents - and it certainly did!\nA national forest fire in May 1971, the Little Sioux fire, just outside the BWCA provided an opportunity to study the effects of a forest fire on the limnology of lakes within the burned area and on the forest ecosystem (Wright 1996). This was the first major area to be burnt since the US Forest Service initiated their fire-suppression programme in 1910. The results provided new insights into fire-lake interactions (e.g. Bradbury 1986; Bradbury et al. 1975; Grigal & McColl 1975; McColl & Grigal 1975; Tarapchak & Wright 1986; RF Wright 1976).\nHerb returned to Minnesotan fire history when his doctoral student James (‘Jim’) C Clark improved techniques for analysing and quantifying charcoal in lake sediments by using petrographic thin sections (Clark 1988a, 1990a) and provided an underlying theory for charcoal records (Clark 1988b). Clark studied three deep lakes with annually laminated sediments in the Itasca State Park in north-western Minnesota. Greater charcoal abundances, except after 1910 (when fire-suppression policies began) were during times of low lake-levels (Clark 1988c, 1989, 1990a). The charcoal records were not exactly the same for the three lakes, because different fires affected different catchments, as determined by fire scars on old pines dating back for several centuries (Wright 1992a). The charcoal record for the last 750 years at Deming Lake suggested maxima of fire frequency about every 90 years during the last few centuries of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (1700s, 1790s, 1880s) but a frequency about half that during the warm centuries preceding the ‘Little Ice Age’. Clark (1988c, 1990b) proposed a climatic periodicity based on the sunspot cycle of 22 years but that during an overall cool phase like the ‘Little Ice Age’ it took four cycles to build up enough dry fuel to sustain major fires compared to half that interval for a warm phase (Wright 1992a). These results suggest, for example, why fire suppression in the Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains since 1910 resulted in the great fuel accumulation that sustained the massive forest fires of 1988 and suggest how a combination of warm climate predicted for the 21st century and continuous fire suppression will result in even greater conflagrations in the future (Wright 1992a).\nHerb’s never-ending sense of adventure, love of wilderness areas, and fascination of geo-archaeological research resulted in another fire-history project, this time where Herb describes as “seven trips I made to the wonderful insect-infested wilderness of Labrador” (Farrand et al. 1990). This work resulted from an idea from the Arctic archaeologist Bill Fitzhugh that interactions between Native American and Inuit populations in Labrador were linked to the movements of reindeer (caribou) herds which depend on ground lichens such as Cladonia, Cladina, Cetrararia, and Stereocaulon as a major food resource. The initial hypothesis was that the extensive lichen cover was controlled by the occurrence and distribution of forest fires. Fire history could be reconstructed from charcoal preserved in Labrador lake sediments (Farrand et al. 1990). Although the initial hypothesis was intractable (Wright 1996), extensive palaeoecological investigations were made by several of Wright’s students on vegetational history (e.g. Lamb 1980, 1984, 1985), fire history (e.g. Foster 1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1985), landscape and peatland development (e.g. Foster & Glaser 1986; Foster & King 1984; Foster et al. 1983, 1988a, 1988b; Glaser & Foster 1984), lake history (e.g. Engstrom 1984; Engstrom & Hansen 1985; Engstrom & Wright 1984), limnology (e.g. Engstrom 1987), and climate change, glacial history, and deglaciation (e.g. King 1985). Herb’s fieldwork in the Labrador wilderness, along with sediment-coring attempts at Elk Lake have swelled the many legendary stories of adventures and misadventures of fieldwork with Herb (Engstrom 2015). In a characteristically modest way, Herb wrote about the Labrador project “I served as field assistant and devil’s advocate around the campfire” (Farrand et al. 1990).\nHerb also had a major influence on establishing detailed fire histories and long-term fire-ecological studies in Europe by asking Brigitta Ammann in Bern (Ammann 2016) “what is known about fire history in Switzerland?” This question initiated a Swiss National Science Foundation project (1993–95) which produced the first European charcoal–fire calibration study (Tinner et al. 1998) and provided new detailed insights into the fire ecology of central Europe (Tinner et al. 1999). In 1999, Herb convinced Willy Tinner, a PhD student of Brigitta Ammann to visit Feng Sheng Hu, a post-doctoral associate of Herb’s who had just been appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois. During his year in the USA, Willy organised sediment-coring expeditions in Alaska to reconstruct the Holocene fire history of the Copper River Basin. The 1999 field campaign only succeeded because of Herb’s great field experience, because after days of endless driving across the entire Copper River Basin, Herb immediately recognised Grizzly Lake as one of the most promising lakes in the area. Studies on the Grizzly Lake sediments (Tinner et al. 2006, 2015) have shown Herb’s choice was correct, as it so often was. When it came to site selection, Herb lived up to his initials – Hardly Ever Wrong!\nReconstructing fire history and fire frequency is now a major research activity in Holocene palaeoecology in the Americas, Europe, and elsewhere, due in part, to the pioneering work by Herb and his students and associates such as Bud Heinselman, Al Swain, Ed Cushing, David Foster, Jim Clark, Cathy Whitlock, Willy Tinner, and others.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright was as much at home in the field, even under difficult or sometimes atrocious conditions, as he was in his office in Pillsbury Hall (he often had its windows open even in winter!) or sitting by the wood fire in the living-room of his Hythe Street home in St Paul reading, listening to music, and editing manuscripts. Besides having the many skills of a Quaternary geologist, geomorphologist, and palaeoecologist to decipher stratigraphical sections, understand landforms, and interpret biotic changes, Herb had a passion for coring sediments in lakes and mires for subsequent pollen or other palaeoecological analyses (Wright 2010). It is unclear when and where Herb collected his first sediment cores, possibly as early as the mid-1950s in Iran or the Chuska Mountains in New Mexico but maybe in the late 1950s in Minnesota. He initially cored from the peaty margins of lakes in Iran or New Mexico or from the winter lake-ice in Minnesota. He perfected coring from open-water (Wright et al. 1965) using a variety of set-ups to allow operations from boats of various sizes and qualities, including canoes, home-made rafts, fallen logs, wooden frames, and even truck-tyre inner-tubes. He developed a much-improved 5-cm diameter stationary piston corer with an inner square rod (Wright 1967) and light-weight but strong magnesium-alloy drive rods (Wright 2010), as well as other types of corers (Wright 1980c).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and his son Dick with an early model of a Livingstone piston corer at Lake Zeribar, Iran, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright sediment-coring from an ingenious (and rather elaborate for Herb!) platform made of local poplar poles at Nilofar spring lake, Iran, 1963 (photo by Bob Megard)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright attempting to sediment-core from a tyre inner-tube at Little Giant Basin, San Juan Mountains, Colorado, July 1959 (photo by Lou Maher)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and his double at the Geological Society of America annual meeting in Minneapolis, 2011 (provider of photo unknown)\n\n\nHe produced in conjunction with Jim Smith at a small machine-shop in St Paul hundreds of square-rod corers (including later a version suitable for coring into fibrous peat; Wright et al. 1984) and constructed over 4000 m of drive rods for colleagues around the world (Wright 2010). There seems to be a physical limit to how much sediment can be collected with this type of equipment, even with the help of chain-hoists and a drill-frame (Cushing & Wright 1965; Wright 1980c, 1991; Wright et al. 1965). Herb’s record is 40 m of core from Lake Zeribar collected in 1970 from a fringing peat mat (Wright 2010). This may be a world record.\nFieldwork with Herb could often turn into an adventure, even a serious adventure, or even a struggle for survival (Birks 2016; Birks & Birks 2016a; Engstrom 2015; Shay 2016). Minnesotan or Dakotan winters can be cold, even very cold, the high Peruvian Andes of 3000+ m (Wright 1986) have less oxygen than at sea-level, and northern boreal areas far from civilisation like the Yukon, Alaska, and Labrador can be insect-infested in the summer. Herb usually brought sub-optimal coring equipment and boats, and minimal food and overnight bivouac equipment with him, for example one snow-shoe is of limited use with deep soft snow at just above freezing point. His field vehicles were usually inadequate or had seen better days and they frequently ran out of petrol as mysteriously the fuel gauge usually did not function. Amongst his colleagues and students, there are masses of stories of adventures with Herb in the field (Almendinger and Jennings 2016; Baker 2016, Birks 2016; Birks & Birks 2016a; Engstrom 2015; McAndrews 2016; Shay 2016). Some of these have acquired legendary status. Herb particularly liked to sleep out ‘under the stars’ – he was quietly proud that he had slept out on all continents including Antarctica! Once in the Serra da Estrêla, eastern Portugal (Ammann 2016), Herb was sleeping out amongst granite blocks and tors. We had to leave early to get to Lisbon for a flight. We were about to leave in the dark when someone said “where is Herb?” I encouraged people to be quiet and listen carefully. His distinctive snore was soon heard, Herb was located, and the complete group left for Lisbon at 04:30!\nHerb emphasised that “ingenuity and resourcefulness in the field are particularly essential in coring operations, but it is important to understand the physical principles involved in how the equipment works and why it sometimes doesn’t work” (Wright 1991). Very many of his field colleagues would reiterate the importance of ingenuity and resourcefulness (and personal survival skills) when being in the field with Herb! It remains a total mystery why Herb would set off on coring expeditions so poorly prepared with old, barely functional equipment and inadequate boats, food, or clothing and with seemingly little concern for safety of himself or his colleagues (Engstrom 2015).\n\n\n\nTwo of Herb Wright’s many attributes were his ability to write clear and concise prose and his great patience to edit (and often re-write) other people’s manuscripts to make them as clear and as concise as possible (Amman 2016). In his 71 years of scientific publication from his first (Wright 1943) to his last (Ammann et al. 2014) publication, Herb’s papers are models of simple, concise, and elegant scientific writing. He encouraged all his students and colleagues to read, study, and follow Strunk and White’s (1979) The Elements of Style.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright writing and editing a manuscript about the vegetational history of Minnesota, 1995 (photo by Brigitta Ammann)\n\n\nHerb published over 200 scientific articles or book chapters, edited 15 books, and six Special Issues of journals (see Appendix and publication list). He edited and often rewrote thousands of manuscripts by colleagues from all over the world, modestly writing in his comments and edits in pencil. For example, he played a major part (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’) in the editing and illustrating of Palaeoecological Events During the Last 15,000 Years (Berglund et al. 1996), a compilation of Holocene events and important pollen-stratigraphical diagrams for almost all European countries. Herb (Wright, unpublished note ‘Wengen 2’) commented about editing the magnum opus The Quaternary of the United States (Wright & Frey 1965) “I must have enjoyed doing this – perhaps it goes back to my days editing the high-school newsletter – so I agreed to edit the proceedings, which involved finding publishers around the country who would take on a symposium with supplementary related papers.”\nMany of the books he edited remain as major contributions to the literature of Quaternary research (e.g. Ruddiman & Wright 1987; Velichkoet al. 1984; Wright 1983b; Wright & Frey 1965; Wrightet al. 1993). Besides writing a large number of excellent primary research papers, Herb had a particular skill at synthesis and at writing many valuable and insightful review papers on a range of topics, starting with the Late Pleistocene climate of Europe: a review (Wright 1961a). Some of his most important reviews, as valuable today as they were when first published, include Wright (1966, 1968b, 1971b, 1974b, 1976c, 1976d, 1977b, 1981a, 1984c, 1987, 1989b), Watson and Wright (1980), and Yu and Wright (2001).\nHerb had a brilliant eye for design and for detail. In conjunction with draughtsman Richard (‘Dick’) Darling at the LRC in the 1960s and artist Rebne Karchefsky in the 1970s, they produced many outstanding illustrations of complex pollen-analytical data for publications (e.g. Birks 1976; Janssen 1967a, 1967c, 1984; Wright & Watts 1969; see Fægri 1973 for comments). A life-size portrait of Herb in the field, painted by Rebne, hangs on the walls of Pillsbury Hall in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Minnesota. It was painted as part of Herb’s retirement functions from his Regents’ Professorship in 1988.\n\n\n\nPortrait of Herb Wright in the Lost River Peatland, northern Minnesota painted by Rebne Karchefsky on the occasion of Herb’s official retirement.\n\n\nHerb’s generosity in editing (and often rewriting) manuscripts for his colleagues worldwide contributed greatly not only to the quality of the Quaternary literature but also invaluable scientific networking and international collaborations (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen 2’ and ‘Sils remarks’).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright was one of the most international Quaternary scientists of his generation, Soon after World War II, he travelled widely by train, bicycle, and motorbike in Europe and met many of the leading Quaternary geologists and geomorphologists in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria (Wright 1957a, 1961b; Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’). Herb already had a nascent interest in lakes and pollen analysis acquired during his graduate days from Kirk Bryan Sr, so in the early 1950s he visited the major European Quaternary pollen laboratories in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and England. He was also active in geological and archaeological studies in Lebanon and Iraq. By 1955 Herb had thus established a strong communication network of Quaternary geologists, palaeoecologists, and archaeologists (Wright, unpublished notes ‘Wengen’ and ‘Sils remarks’. When the Minnesota pollen laboratory and the Limnological Research Center were founded in 1958 and 1959, respectively, it was natural that it was quickly populated by European palynologists and later palaeolimnologists. These visitors not only helped develop the pollen and LRC laboratories and build up their facilities, but also helped to train a large number of graduate students, many of whom are now leading Quaternary scientists in their respective fields. At least 18 countries were represented in the LRC from 1963 to 1990 whilst Herb was its director. The strong camaraderie within Herb’s LRC of the 1970s and 1980s lives on thanks to the friendships that developed in the LRC, at seminars in Herb’s house, and in the field (Björck 2016).\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and the 2002 International Moor Excursion at Kråkenes, western Norway. This is a late-glacial site intensively studied by Hilary Birks and colleagues. Herb helped Hilary edit a Special Issue of Journal of Paleolimnology on the reconstruction of the late-glacial and early-Holocene aquatic ecosystems at Kråkenes Lake. Herb is sitting on the far left and Hilary is sitting at the far right in the front.\n\n\nIn his retirement, Herb was a regular visitor to Europe to visit laboratories and friends, explore new landscapes, and, of course, help core lakes and mires. In addition he was a regular participant on the annual Moor Excursion (Moorexkursion) (later also lakes) of the University of Bern instigated and organised by Gerhard Lang (1924-2016) in 1976, and continued by Brigitta Ammann from 1990 to 2006, and by Willy Tinner from 2007 to today. Between 1980 and 2007, Herb joined 15 of these excursions (Ammann 2016) and attended several international conferences and workshops in Europe. On the occasion of his 90th birthday, Herb wrote “I have felt like an academic uncle to her [Brigitta Ammann, Bern] students, whom I have helped with the englishification (John Birks would say americanization) of their manuscripts in preparation for publication” (Wright, unpublished note ‘Sils remarks’). He helped many colleagues core sediments in lakes and mires in Europe, as well as in Peru, Bolivia, Alaska, and Kenya. In his characteristically generous way, he played a large part in the fieldwork and/or in raising research money for several of these expeditions and in writing and editing the resulting manuscripts (e.g. Ahlberget al. 2000; Ammannet al. 2013; Birks & Wright 2000a, 2000b; Blyakharchuket al. 2004, 2007, 2008; Engstromet al. 2000; Stefanovaet al. 2006a, 2006b; Tinneret al. 2006, 2015; Verschurenet al. 2000; Westoveret al. 2006; Wrightet al. 2003).\nHerb was a truly international scientist with very extensive and effective trans-Atlantic scientific networks and collaborations that he maintained and extended for over 60 years. He was a great polymath in his approach to science and his research interests and achievements.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright and friends at the Morteratsch Glacier, Engadine, Switzerland on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2007.

    "text": "Herb Wright’s legacies to Quaternary science and to our understanding of landscapes and environmental history are immense. He published prolifically, researched globally, studied and synthesised many diverse topics, collaborated broadly, advised and influenced multiple graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, colleagues, and friends, and taught in many venues, but his greatest legacy was as a role model for all who knew him and worked with him. He was a remarkable and unique combination of genuine modesty, scientific curiosity, great generosity and kindness, quiet but effective leadership, a passionate love of adventure and wild places, intense loyalty, deep friendship, and strong devotion and service to his university, department, science, colleagues, students, friends, and family. By his example, he taught people to think independently and clearly, to design their projects carefully, to consider multiple working hypotheses, to read the literature both current and older, to attend seminars on topics not directly linked to one’s particular project, and to interact effectively. He was a master of scientific synthesis (Engstrom et al. 2016; Whitlock et al. 2016) and he could see links between seemingly disparate topics. He encouraged people to think logically and laterally, as he did and to discover new connections between different palaeoecological, palaeoclimatological, and ecological patterns and processes.\nHerb’s approach to science is elegantly summarised by Shane and Cushing (1991a) who wrote in the preface to the book Quaternary Landscapes that honoured Wright on the occasion of his formal retirement from the University of Minnesota.\n\n“He [Wright] has accomplished so much by carefully cultivating within the Limnological Research Center an atmosphere of cooperation, scholarly exchange, interdisciplinary research, and continuing international contacts.\nWright has modeled much of his teaching and research style on that of Kirk Bryan. For his students and colleagues this has meant friendship combined with independence of thought and work, wide-ranging discussions, stimulating seminars in Herb and Rhea’s home, and fantastic field trips with varied hardships. We have learned from him again and again that new technology such as isotopic dating techniques and computerized data manipulation provides only tools, not final answers; that scientific research is clearly and specifically founded in the most basic disciplines of orderly thought, constant questioning, and being sure of what one understands before moving toward speculation. In his leadership of the LRC, Herbert E. Wright, Jr., has shown us that careful research based on the desire for cooperation and discovery, and not tied to traditional scholarly boundaries, has both scientific and human value.”\n\nHerb also taught many of his collaborators the importance of dogged determinism, ingenuity, and perseverance in the field, particularly in the harsh conditions of a Minnesota winter or the trying conditions in wilderness areas with hordes of insects in the Yukon or Labrador. Through these hardships, strong bonds and friendships developed, many of which continue to the present (Björck 2016). Such long-lasting friendships are something that Herb must have been very proud of, as they symbolise so well the unique character of the LRC that he created, developed, and nurtured between 1963 and 1990. Herb really was a great giant in so many ways.\nHerb’s name will also live on through his invention of the Wright square-rod piston corer (Wright 1967). He also has a peak named after him, Wright Peak (1510 m) 0.9 km south of Sutley Peak in the Jones Mountains, Antarctica (73° 40’ S, 94° 32’ W). It was mapped by the University of Minnesota Jones Mountains Party of 1960-61 who named it for Wright who was an advisor to the Party. Wright visited Antarctica including Wright Peak in the 1961-62 season.\nThe obituaries and memorials by Almendinger and Jennings (2016), Anfinson (2016), Birks and Birks (2016b), Birks et al. (2016), Björck (2016), Engstrom et al. (2016), and Whitlock et al. (2016) discuss additional aspects of Herb’s legacies, leadership, and mentoring."

    "text": "Herb Wright was by far the most important mentor in my scientific career and my life (Birks 2014). My post-doctoral year in 1970 at the LRC with Herb and Ed Cushing was a career-changing event (Birks 2014). Many of my subsequent research activities and interests have their first roots in Room 218 in Pillsbury Hall, at seminars in Herb’s home, in the winter wilds of Minnesota or Wisconsin, in the summer heat of Florida, somewhere driving across the vast Northern Great Plains with Herb, Ed, and others, or in the St Elias Mountains of the Yukon in 1971 – numerical methods, quantitative environmental reconstructions, adventure botany and expeditions, modern pollen–vegetation relationships, linking vegetation history with palaeolimnology, detailed pollen morphology, quantitative pollen-stratigraphical analysis, diatoms and water chemistry, broad-scale vegetation changes and pollen mapping, tree migration patterns, etc. Through Herb and his wide network of research colleagues and regular stream of visitors to the LRC (e.g. Roel Janssen, Lou Maher, Bill Watts, Willem van Zeist), or fieldwork helpers (e.g. Dick Baker, Jock McAndrews, Tom Webb) I was able to meet and interact at an early stage in my career with many wonderful and stimulating colleagues, all linked by their close association and friendship with Herb. Herb was a very major influence on my life and my research and I miss him greatly. I owe so much to him.\n\n\n\nHerb Wright in Blekinge, 1979 (photo Björn E Berglund)"

    "text": "Where Herb Has Not Yet Gone Before\nby Jim Almendinger\nIn honor of Herb’s 90th birthday, which was celebrated in Sils, Switzerland, 2007\nIn ages long gone, when I started grad school,\nProfessors gave simple advice:\nChoose your sites wisely, for only a fool\nWould choose to core a lake twice.\nSeek out new sandplains and tills of ablation1 –\nThere you’ll find lakes you should core.\nGo to new lands and civilizations\nWhere no one has yet gone before.\nSo I drove a ways north and a little ways west\nAnd sampled a pothole or two.\nWith thousands of lakes there, the chances, at best,\nThat someone had cored these, were few.\nYet when I came back, I was given a fright:\nMy advisor had eyed me with scorn.\n“Those lake have been published by our friend Herb Wright,\n“Who cored them before you were born!”\nOK, not a problem, I pushed on ahead\nAnd chose some lakes out a bit further.\nTo prairies I drove, and faster I sped\nTo sample the few lakes that were there.\nAgain I returned, all happy and cheery\nMy advisor said, “Sorry to trouble you!!\n“Who first cored those lakes? Have you not a theory?\n“That’s right – it was old HEW!”\nAgain I resolved to continue my toil,\nIn the Canadian Maritimes, where\nAfter coring, I noticed a scrap of tin foil,\nAnd I knew that Herb Wright had been there!\nIn anger I pressed on and went further north;\nThe bush pilots thought I was daft.\nBut at each site Herb’s residue clearly lay forth,\nLike scraps from an old rubber raft.\nI went to the west, far into Alaska\nWhere an old timer said with delight,\n“If you’re coring lakes, I think I should ask ya –\n“How is my old friend, Herb Wright?”\nI went to the south, to far Patagonia\nTo regions not given a name\nThen to shy cloistered corners in old Catalonia,\nBut the answer was always the same.\nTo Egypt, to Sweden, to tiny Swaziland,\nTo the southernmost tip of Tasmania,\nTo Greenland, to Iceland, and then to New Zealand –\nI madly continued my mania!\nI traveled by camel to outer Mongolia,\nTo plains that the wind had laid bare.\nTo find once again, just like I have told ya,\nThat Herb had been already there.\nIn Persia, Herb cored with one Cyrus the Great\nIn Baghdad, with this or that sultan\nFor a thousand and one nights, he labored ’til late\nWriting a paper or bulletin.\nHe cored in Arabian wadis2 with Lawrence;\nHe cored in the Sudanese sands.\nHe cored with da Vinci some wetlands near Florence\nAnd on his pants wiped off his hands.\nHe traveled with Captain James Cook to Hawaii,\nAnd ate a big sandwich3 for lunch.\nAnd then with his portable coring supply, he\nCored a salt marsh on a hunch.\nHe jumped ship in Tahiti4 and swam to the shore\nWhere the women don’t wear any tops.\nHe cored crater lakes, peat bogs, lagoons, and still more – And toasted each one with a schnapps\nTo the Llanos5 he traveled with Bonpland and Humboldt\nTo wade in the riverine muck,\nAnd ended up wrestling with eels full of volts6\nWhile getting his sampler unstuck.\nHe met up with Darwin7 to core a few lakes,\nWhile Darwin was stumped by his finches.\nWhen questioned by Herb, Charles saw his mistakes,\nAnd in gratitude manned the core winches.\nHerb’s rod, it was square! His stainless head shone!\nHis coring tube’s wall – it was lean!\nZirconium magnesium made up his bones,\nWith aluminum couplings between8.\nSo…\nI’d traveled the globe, neither heeded nor aided,\nTo seek out a lake of my own,\nBut only to find, a world perforated\nLike Swiss cheese by Herb’s Livingstone9.\nI returned in my sorrow, and full of despair.\nWhat could I do possibly more?\nWhen a voice from the shadows – the Devil, I swear!\nSaid, “I have a lake you can core…”\n“It has a stratigraphy nine layers deep10,\n“Core shallow or deep as you choose.\n“But to get an age model, the dates won’t come cheap,\n“From mud of salacious11 dark ooze.”\n“But here is the catch, which some may think nice,\n“To sample continuous sediment.\n“I propose that you wait for a platform of ice,\n“And core there without an impediment.”\nSo I’m waiting in Hades; I’m tortured, disturbed,\nFor sediment I’ve suffered woe for,\nTo finally core a lake not cored by Herb,\nWhen finally, Hell freezes over!\nNOTES:\n1Ablation is the melting of glacial ice.\n2A wadi is a gully, typically dry except in the rainy season, but where oases would be found.\n3The Hawaiian Islands were once known, of course, as the Sandwich Islands. Cook was the first European to discover the islands in 1778, and died there in 1779 during a conflict with the natives.\n4If Herb were sailing with Captain Bligh on the HMS Bounty, this would have been 1789.\n5The Llanos are the grassy plains of Venezuela and Columbia along the Orinoco River, visited by Alexander von Humbolt and Aimé Bonpland in 1800.\n6Humboldt confirmed the existence of electric eels, which live in the muddy pools of the Orinoco.\n7Darwin was in the Galapagos Islands in 1835; so, too, apparently was Herb.\n8Herb re-designed the lake-sediment sampler originally designed by Dan Livingstone, introducing a square inner rod, a stainless steel sampler head, a thin (“lean”) walled stainless steel coring tube, and zirconium-magnesium coring rods connected by anodized aluminum couplings.\n9The modified Livingstone sampler, as described above.\n10The nine circles of Hell, as described in Dante’s Inferno.\n11In the oceans, the ooze is siliceous; in Hell, salacious."

    "text": "by H.E. Wright\nThe incentive for these notes comes from the initiative of Geoff Seltzer to assemble as many of the LRC alumni and alumnae as could be found on short notice for a photograph on the steps of Pillsbury Hall on the occasion of the American Quaternary Association meeting in June (1994). Everyone was arrayed chronologically on the steps, and a list was compiled with names and periods of tenure. I thought it would be interesting to provide some notes to supplement the bare chronology, and to add the names of those graduate students and post-docs in or near the LRC _who frequented Pillsbury Hall and who are not represented in the photograph. The LRC was preceded by the pollen laboratory, initiated in 1956 by a grant from the Hill Family Foundation. In 1963 the LRC was established by a separate grant from the Hill Family Foundation, and the pollen laboratory was incorporated within it. The pollen laboratory revolved in successive years around the year-long visits of experienced paleoecologists from European laboratories, starting with Magnus Fries from Sweden and followed by Saskia Jelgersma from The Netherlands, Willem van Zeist from The Netherlands, Bill Watts from Ireland, Roel Janssen from The Netherlands, Maj-Britt Florin from Sweden, Krystyna Wasylikowa and Kazik Wasylik from Poland, Johanna and Eberhard Grüger from Germany, Elizabeth Haworth from England, John and Hilary Birks from England, and (in later years) Rick Battarbee from England, Svante Björck from Sweden, and Jan Janssens from Belgium via Canada. Several of these persons returned in subsequent years, notably Bill Watts, Roel Janssen, John Birks, and Svante Björck. Foreign visitors for several months included Richard West and Kevin Edwards (England), Jan Mangerud (Norway), Norio Fuji (Japan), and Alojz Sercelj (Yugoslavia). On the neolimnological side Gunilla Lindmark came from Sweden and Dragica Matulova from Czechoslovakia. This foreign flavor was supplemented by students from Ireland (Alan Craig, Norman Allott, Henry Lamb, Joan Lennon, Roger Dutton), Japan (Junko Ogawa), Finland (Liisa Koivo), Canada (Vern Rampton), Sweden (Kerstin Griffin, Elisabeth Almgren, Karin Ahlberg), The Netherlands (Rik Jansen), and Belgium (Dirk Verschuren). In the last few years with the coming of Kerry Kelts from Switzerland the foreign contingent has included post-docs from Spain (Bias Valero­Garces), Germany (Antje Schwalb), France (Babette Truze), and Canada (Brian Cumming), as well as students from China (Juanjuan Xia, Jun-Qing Yu, Zhigang Gong, Yue Han). Non-foreign post-docs have included Ed Cushing, Bob Megard, Linda Shane, Paul Glaser, Dan Engstrom, Sheri Fritz, John Bradbury, Mel Whiteside, Dick Brugam, Tom Crisman, John Kingston, Brian Haskell, and Michael Rosen. Jean Waddington managed the pollen laboratory for many years before Linda Shane. Tom Johnson of the Geology faculty was closely affiliated with the LRC just before moving to Duluth, and Emi Ito has recently become an active member. Of course, many others were associated with the LRC over the years, such as technicians, secretaries, and undergraduate helpers, and many of these were critical for the social ambience. In the following list the numbers before the names are keyed to the photograph. The dates were provided by those present or were extracted from annual reports of the LRC or other sources. Current locations are given where known. Any corrections and up-dating would be appreciated.\n\n20 August 1994\n\n\n\nH.E.

    "text": "Adventures in Minnesota 1970: From Myrtle Lake to Mantrap Lake\nHilary Birks\nTogether with John Birks, I spent a post-doctoral year at the LRC with Herb Wright. It was one of the most enjoyable years of my life. My primary aim was to study the modern distribution of seeds and fruits within lakes in order to facilitate the interpretation of fossil data. So I set to and learned macrofossil analysis using the excellent reference collection amassed by Bob Bright, Bill Watts, and others.\nWe arrived in January 1970 at -17F (-22C) and were shocked as we got off the plane and our noses froze. The next morning, we set off for Pillsbury Hall. It was a beautiful sunny day. But we were completely fooled by the temperature and the wind chill. A few yards beyond the motel, we turned back and found a lot more warm clothes! Bill had advised us not to go in September as the winter is very long and cold. It was good advice. However, before I could do any fieldwork on my project, I had to wait until summer. Herb had an EPA grant to study the pollution of Sallie Lake near Detroit Lakes City and I became part of this project. So Herb, Mark Mantovani, and I set off in Herb’s field-car, the ‘yellow peril’ to obtain a short core from St Clair Lake upstream in the same catchment, which received direct inflow from the city. It is a shallow lake and acts as a filter before the water reaches Sallie Lake. It was cold fine weather, but with a significant wind chill. We reached the lake, unloaded, and took a short core of the sediments from the middle of the lake from the ice. Herb looked round at me and said quietly, “Your nose has turned white. Rub it”. Likewise, my ears experienced frostnip. They have been sensitive to cold winds ever since. For some reason, probably due to the lack of a functioning gas gauge, we ran out of gas several times. In the end, the car was running on snowmobile fuel, which I don’t suppose did it much good - but it was probably insensitive to such things at its age.\n\n\n\nAerial view of Myrtle Lake surrounded by swamp spruce forest\n\n\nI had never been so cold before. But worse was to come. Roel Janssen had been analysing surface pollen samples within the Red Lake Peatland, which included Myrtle Lake, in northeast Minnesota. He wanted Herb to get a core from the lake for him so that he could make a regional pollen diagram and use his surface samples to interpret it in terms of past vegetation. Herb pressganged John and I to go coring with him together with Rex Wright and Bud Heinselman. Myrtle Lake is surrounded by Picea mariana peatland forest. At the start of the trail to the lake, we all confidently set off with a snow-mobile, one snow-shoe (!), basic food, tent, coring equipment, etc. The air-temperature was +37F (2.5C) and the snow was wet and slushy and very hard to walk through. We set up camp on a duck-hunters wooden platform. Unfortunately, the edge of the tent did not quite reach the ground but we managed. Bud had seen the weather forecast and knew a cold front was approaching straight from the Arctic. Indeed, we could feel it getting colder. Bud got us all collecting as much wood as possible while it was still light to keep a good fire going. After a chilly supper, we tried to sleep. Herb had kindly given me his Antarctic sleeping bag, but I was still frozen. I made the big mistake of leaving my boots outside the sleeping bag and had a minor drama during the night when I had to get out. As the temperature plunged to -340F (-370C), we all tried to sleep. But my teeth kept involuntarily chattering and helped to keep everyone awake. All except Herb, who snored quietly in his corner of the tent. In the morning his beard was sealed with icicles, so he was quieter than normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb with his frozen beard\nFrozen breakfast\n\n\n\nBreakfast was minimal, as everything was frozen solid; bananas like bricks, grapefruit like cannonballs. We managed to thaw out some cereal bars over the fire. We had come to core, so we gathered up the equipment and set off on to the lake-ice. John lent Herb his red jumper as he was ill-equipped. Out of the shelter of the forest, the wind was bitterly cold. We managed to make a hole in the ice and put the corer down. No problem, until we pulled it up again. The water on it froze instantly, making the rods hard to hold and disconnect, and the square rod impossible to turn. Disheartened, we returned to shore. Herb had the idea that we could core through the peat forest. But the ground was frozen and impossible to penetrate. Herb’s next idea was to core through the fire. Good thinking; the fire would have melted the frozen ground. But this did not work either, because naturally the ground was full of tree roots. And the smoke from the fire left us coughing and spluttering.\n\n\n\nCoring through the fire\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing to light a fire under the snowmobile so it would start\n\n\nBy this time, it was late in the day, so retreat was inevitable. It should be easier to walk out on the now frozen snow. However, the snowmobile would not start; it had frozen along with everything else. Ever resourceful, Bud raised it on some coring rods and lit a small fire under the engine. This did the trick, and we were away. We reached the road where the yellow peril was parked. Needless to say, it was frozen solid too and would not start. We were preparing to light a fire under its engine, when fortunately a local man drove past. He kindly drove off and returned with some jump leads that allowed us to start the car. We were eternally grateful, as were not looking forward to another night of camping.\nOn the way back to the Twin Cities, Bud, always the source of good ideas, suggested we might stop in Ely and get an evening meal - we had hardly eaten for the last 28 hours. As we entered a rundown cafe bar, a drunken Minnesotan looked at this dishevelled bunch of people with beards, long hair, and dirty clothes and hurled his beer at us and shouted “bloody Californian hippies!” We finally got back to St Paul early next morning without any core at all. Herb later admitted that this was a new experience for him to return without a core. The name ‘Janssen’ was barely mentioned for a few weeks as we thought of him sitting in his warm office while we nearly froze to death in our attempts to get him some Myrtle Lake mud! I doubt we would have even survived without Bud and his woodsmanship.\n\n\n\nCoring Wolkf Creek\n\n\nJohn’s task in Minnesota was to investigate the floral and vegetational development on recently deglaciated land during the late-glacial period. After perusal of the maps and Herb’s great knowledge of the glacial terrain, he chose a site called Wolf Creek, an infilled inter-drumlin palaeolake. Herb drove us and Bob Bailey in the yellow peril, and it was cool (on the feet) to see the snowy road through the floor of the car. Herb had not brought the coring frame, so we erected a tripod of coring rods tied together with yellow rope. This eventually became a bipod as we needed the rod! Herb used his large-diameter square rod piston sampler, and we extruded each section by pushing against the tyre of the car. Mission successful!\nJohn wanted a second site, so Herb suggested Kylen Lake in the Toimi drumlin field which should have old sediments. By now, winter was coming to an end, so we three hurried out to Kylen Lake. Getting on to the lake ice was easy. Coring went moderately well, and we retrieved a good core. But it had taken longer than expected, and darkness fell before we were quite finished. Finally we trudged back to the shore, only to find that a moat had melted during the day. We did not fancy spending the night on Kylen Lake waiting for it to freeze again, so we got rather wet reaching dry land with ungainly splashing leaps and a toboggan ‘bridge’.\n\n\n\nCoring Kylen Lake\n\n\nSpring suddenly arrived in April, the snow melted, and flowers opened. We tried to follow the development of spring northwards, after a good start on Alice Prairie and Kasota Prairie, with millions of stunning pasque flowers. The progression of spring was very rapid, but by driving further and further north each weekend, we did manage to see the forest floor carpeted with Trillium grandiflorum and other beautiful plants. We made several more plant hunts during the summer, especially with Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKasota Prairie\n\nAnemone patens\n\n\n\nMamillaria vivipara - do not kneel on this!\n\nStudying Shepherdia argentea in N Dakota; Herb, John, Roel, Ed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Ed and Caroline Cushing and family at Cedar Creek in May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpigaea repens\n\nLilium michiganens\n\nCypripedium calceolus\n\nUvularia grandiflora\n\n\n\nAs spring turned to summer, it was time to start taking surface mud samples from lakes in the three main biomes present in Minnesota; prairie, deciduous forest, and coniferous-deciduous forest (boreal forest). I had considered investigating the lakes’ flora using SCUBA diving, and qualified on a course in a local swimming pool. I made one dive in Lake Itasca accompanied by Mel Whiteside. It was fantastic to see graceful forests of giant Ceratophyllum demersum. However, my plan to dive to my sites was scuppered, because one needed a diving buddy, and John could not even swim. My approach was to describe the flora and vegetation of the lakes and their marginal swamps, and then to take surface mud samples in transects from shallow to deep water in the different vegetation zones with an Eckman dredge. I described the aquatic vegetation from five grab samples taken around my boat and visual assessment where possible.\n\n\n\nWoodworth Prairie Pond, N Dakota\n\n\nAt most of the 32 lakes I sampled I was accompanied by John. When Roel Janssen visited, we sampled some lakes, including an attempt at Lake Sylvia to get surface samples for Roel. We had to cross a large Typha marsh with willow bushes to reach the open water. We gradually sank below boot height. Roel thought that if we used a toboggan to distribute our weight, we might get there. We got further, but then the toboggan sank, us with it, and we had to give up.\n\n\n\nRoel Janssen and the toboggan\n\n\nTo sample the lakes in NE Minnesota in the coniferous forest, we spent a pleasant time with Bob and Ann Carlson in their cabin and paddled around the beautiful lakes in their canoe. We found Xyris montana, a dainty yellow sisyrinchium flower, beside one lake, which was new to the flora of Minnesota. It has since been discovered in several localities.\n\n\n\nWampus Lake in NE Minnesota\n\n\nI made one sampling expedition on my own to central Minnesota. After sampling a couple of lakes, I arrived at Mantrap Lake. There was a large floating sedge-swamp around the shore, which I struggled over using the boat to stop me sinking. Out on the lake, I was about to start sampling, when the floor of Herb’s inflatable yellow dinghy (called a dingy by Roel Janssen) started to come away from the rim, letting water in. I paddled as fast as possible to the nearest shore, which happened to be covered in a bramble patch, and decided that the lake was well named. Herb’s dinghy was the sort used for playing on beaches. It had no rowlocks and was quite hard to paddle. Ed Cushing said that I should have trashed it ages ago! So I was glad when I could purchase a larger, more sturdy (still yellow) dinghy with rowlocks. I believe Bill and Herb used it later in Florida. I found a lot of mollusc shells in my samples so I got help identifying these from Bob Bright down in the Museum. I never published all the data from the project, including the molluscs, but synthesized the main points in a paper in 1973. Perhaps that bottom drawer should be investigated once more and the mollies resurrected.\nThe pollution project at Detroit Lakes needed two more sites; the target problem lake, Sallie Lake, and a ‘control’ unpolluted lake. For the latter, we chose Elk Lake which Donna Stark had been studying previously with diatoms. We needed a lot of material at fine resolution for a multi-proxy study using pollen, macrofossils, diatoms, and cladocera. So Herb devised a 20cm diameter plastic tube corer of 1m length. It was operated by Mel Whiteside diving, placing the core tube, and when it was pulled up, capping the bottom so that the sediment would not fall out. It worked splendidly and we obtained samples from both Sallie and Elk Lakes. Later, I went to Elk Lake by myself to record the vegetation. On the way out along a muddy track, my car got stuck and I was lucky to be able to reverse and just make it out over the mud.\nWe met many wonderful people in Minneapolis. Don Lawrence allowed us to be guests on his student field trips so we saw some interesting places and vegetation. He invited us to Thanksgiving lunch at his cabin. It was a convivial occasion with lots of roast turkey and pumpkin pie. Ed and Caroline Cushing had also invited us to dinner that evening - more roast turkey and pumpkin pie! We were quite naive about Thanksgiving dinners, so we had to eat far too much delicious food that day. Many other folk were also extremely generous and hospitable to us.\nWe were sad to leave Minneapolis, the LRC, and Herb and Rhea in December (before winter got too bad). Besides all the stimulating science during our year at the LRC, we also made many good friends. Rhea wrote me many of her characteristic type-written letters after we got home, and we were glad to welcome her to Cambridge on two visits. Herb also visited us on several occasions in Cambridge and Bergen. But I have never been back to Minneapolis."

    "text": "by Brigitta Ammann\nHerb was a great traveller and he always had at least two things with him in his mind and his (old) backpack: one or more interesting scientific questions and one or more manuscripts to edit.\n\n\nInformal discussions can help a lot, be it on scientific or personal levels.\n\n\n\nAmbleside: Hazel Juggins, Henry Lamb, Neil Roberts, Herb, Hilary Birks\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Europeans used to think that forest fire was a phenomenon occurring only in Mediterranean and boreal regions but not in central Europe. Then Jim Clark, after completing his thesis in Minnesota, showed us that we were wrong (Clark et al. 1989). At Schleinsee, Jim Clark found a remarkable fire history! Herb asked question 1: “Do you have a fire history in the Alps?” The answer was: “Sorry, we do not know”. So Herb helped to write a proposal to the Swiss NSF – which enabled Willy Tinner  to work out the Holocene fire history for the southern Alps (Tinner et al. 1998, 1999) and  Madlena Beckmann reconstructed the fire history of the central-Alpine dry valley of Valais (Colombaroli et al. 2013).\n\n\n\nHerb cycling around Schleinsee, southern Germany\n\n\nMy first of many visits to 1426 Hythe Street, St Paul – a wonderful place for MANY reasons.\n\n\n\nHerb at his home\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb started to like the “International Moor Excursions” initiated in 1975 by Gerhard Lang, described by Gerhard as: ”For advanced students”. But since the sentence “bonus vir semper student” is also valid for women, we all felt happy and inspired by these excursions (http://www.botany.unibe.ch/imoorex/index.php). This XV International Moor Excursion (IME) was led by Roel Janssen, Paula Queiros, José Mateus, Jacqueline van Leeuwen, and Pim van der Knaap. Herb asked question 2:  What can we learn from steep gradients such as elevational transects? For example from the coast to the Serra de Estrela?\n\n\n\nHerb and Roel Janssen in Lisbon\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in Piazza Navona, Rome, Herb prefers tea to coffee!\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb and Andy Lotter listen to John Birks\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Birks\n\n\nHerb’s question 3: How similar or how different are various amphi-atlantic phenomena (Wright 1977, 1989)? And Herb discussed it with Gerhard Lang.\n\n\n\nHerb and Gerhardt Lang\n\n\nAs a follow-up from question 2, Herb helped us to core five sites in the Central Alps in 1992 (from 600 to 2290 m a.s.l., Ammann et al. 2000).\n\n\n\nIn 1992 we visited Andy Wright in Adelaide and enjoyed the beauties of the Australian south coast and canoeing on the Mighty Murray River.\n\n\n\n\nHerb’s first statement: “Dirk Verschuren needs a new core” – so we cored in the Crescent Island lake of Lake Naivasha (Verschuren et al. 2000). Herb’s second statement: ”Always keep the corer vertical”. We had to be back in camp by noon because the hippopotami become active and do not like shadows over their heads!\n\n\n\nCoring Lake Naivasha with Dirk Verschuren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same summer Herb also cored three lakes in the Slovak Tatra with Kamil Rybniček (Rybníčková & Rybníček 2006). During the excursion of the ‘History of Mountain Flora’ Conference to the Bulgarian Pirin Mountains, Herb stated: “These lakes deserve proper coring” – so he did in 1994, 2002, and 2006.\n\n\n\nThis was the summer when Herb cored six lakes in five days in the Rila and Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria guided by Elisaveta Bozilova. We also travelled in Greece, e.g. to Githio in the southern Peloponnese. Herb’s fascination with the eastern Mediterranean possibly had its roots in his early work in the Levant: the coast of Lebanon (1947), Kurdistan (1961), Zagros Mountains (Wright et al. 1961, 1963, 1967, Stevens et al. 2001), Mycenaean Greece (1968), early food production in Mesopotamia (1968, 1970, 1976, 1993), the Minnesota Messenia expedition (1972) and more. Previously I had thought that “Kalamata” was just a very fine type of olive, but Herb showed me the place and the landscape with its great archaeology.1995\nThe Açores are in a way a stepping stone between North America and Europe and are biogeographically very special. On Flores, are two lakes – Lagoa Funda and Lagoa Rasa – which mean profound lake and shallow lake. Of course we could not core Lagoa Funda, but we did core Lagoa Rasa (second attempt in 1998; Connor et al. 2012).\n\n\n\nWhat secrets do these lakes on the Azores hold?\n\n\nHerb was always very strong in overcoming obstacles.\n\n\n\nBoundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA)\n\n\nSince 1990 we enjoyed the serenity of the BWCA every summer.\n\n\n\nBCWA\n\n\n\n\n\nEly, with Christopher Wright\n\n\nThe 1995 Moor Excursion in Denmark - classical sites and new results presented by friendly Vikings Bent Aaby (below left), Bent Odgaard (below right), and Sven Th. Andersen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Rabassa in Ushuaia wanted a piston corer but did not want to pay for the air freight. Herb replied: “I no longer send corers by ship – but we will bring one!” Also in 1996: Herb receives his third Honorary Doctoral Degree – from University of Minnesota. The Moor Excursion went to Germany, led by T. Litt, S. Schloss, A. Hölzer, J. Kalis, M. Rösch et al.\n\n\n\nHerb in Punta Arenas, Chile\n\n\n\n\n\nMadeira, a beautiful crater lake became a reservoir :(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake of the Clouds is a lot better!\n\n\n\nCoring Lake of the Clouds\n\n\n1997 saw the first coring trip to Georgia\n\n\n\n\nTabazkuri in the Caucasus Minor\n\n\n\n\n\nHospitality in the Radja Mountains\n\n\nAnd Herb’s 80th birthday!\n\n\n\nHerb and Hilary Birks in the village of Wengen (Bernese Oberland)\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb and Kerry Kelts on Jungfraujoch near the research station\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond coring trip to Georgia (Great Caucasus and Caucasus Minor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst coring trip to the Russian Altai. Herb’s original question (no. 4) was based on his transatlantic interest: In the Upper Mid-West of the US there was during the Holocene an east-west swing of the prairie-forest border. Were there similar changes in continental Eurasia? Unfortunately the potential sites in the Kulundinskaya steppe were hopeless. So the question of the elevational gradients was addressed, as well as the fancy drowned pingos.\n\n\n\n\nDzhangyskol with pingos (Blyakharchuk et al. 2008)\n\n\nQuestions 5 and 6 concern many landscapes with patterns: What processes produce such patterns? At small spatial scales (e.g. pingos or patterned peatlands (see 2004)) and at large scales (e.g. the huge river terraces of the Katun River or the giant ripples in the Kuray Basin in the Altai). Ripples remind us of the Channelled Scablands in Washington US (picture in Wright 2005). Pavel Borodavko is a great geomorphologist and can explain the various hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1998 Moor Excursion went to Ontario (guided by Jock McAndrews & Jean-Nicolas Haas).\n\nIn September, a second coring trip to Lagoa Rasa on the Azores (Connor et al. 2012).\n\n\n\nHerb with André Pugin, Stéphanie Girardclos and Michael Wehrli\n\n\nIn 1998 Herb visited the famous Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland and its moraines of the Younger Dryas and 1850.\n\n\n\n\nThis was a busy year. First, spring on La Palma together with Elisabeth Grönlund, working on texts.\n\n\nThen coring in the Czech Republic\n\n\n\nWilly Tanner, Petr Pokorný and Herb in Svarzenberk\n\n\nA second trip to the Russian Altai in 1999, where we cored three sites close to the timberline: Uzun Kol (1985 m), Kedegelju (2050 m), and Tash Kol (2150 m) (Blykhartchuk et al. 2004). One evening when we were all sitting around the campfire one of the students asked me: “Is it not strange for the American professor to sit by an open fire?” No, he does that on at least 300 days of the year, be it indoors or outdoors!\n\n\n\nAt Teplice Skalv\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the campfire\n\n\nNear Uzun Kol we met N. Lashchinsky from Novosibirsk and three colleagues from Göttingen, B. Meyer, F. Lehmkuhl, F. Schlütz\n\nHerb manages to communicate with his blue eyes and a smile!\n\nIn 1999Herb, Willy Tinner, and Petra Kaltenrieder core Grizzly Lake, Alaska (Tinner et al. 2006, 2008, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1999 Moor Excursion goes to The Netherlands. The most popular means of transport in this country is also used during the excursion. Bas van Geel was somewhat worried and asked: “Is it not too much for Herb?” Answer: “Herb is a more experienced biker than most of us – from Hythe Street to Pillsbury Hall he makes 2 x 7 km per day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary saw coring of West Twin and Steel Lake, Minnesota: August saw coring of Ak-Kol and Grusha in the Tuwa Republic, Siberia, &gt;2000 m a.s.l. - but not as cold as Minnesota! (Westover et al. 2006; Blyakhartchuk et al. 2007; Ilyashuk & Ilyashuk 2007; Stefanova & Oeggl 1993). The Moor Excursion went to the Southern Alps.\n\n\n\nCoring Lake Grusha\n\n\n\n\n\nMore coring!\n\n\n\nMoody Lake in February\n\n\nIn September 2001, the Moor Excursion visitedPoland. Leaders were M. Latałowa, K. Tobolski, K. Milecka, M.  Makohonienko, et al.\n\n\n\nThe IME group at the northern coast of Poland\n\n\n[Krystyna Wasylikowa comes from Kraków to see Herb]\n\n\n\nBulgaria, coring in the Pirin mountains. Popovo 2 and 6, Kremensko-5 (2124 m), Besbog (2250 m), Praso (1900 m) (Atanassova & Stefanova 2003; Stefanova & Oeggl 1993; Stefanova et al. 2006 a,b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moor Excursion 2002 brought us to western Norway under the guidance of Hilary and John Birks. Great landscapes, great science, and a relaxing boat trip on Sognefjord.\n\n\n\nVania, Herb, Roel Jansen, Jacqueline van Leeuwen\n\n\n\n\n\nHilary Birks at Kråkenes during the IME to western Norway\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb and Vania at Hythe Street. This is a wonderful symbiosis. Herb: “Yes, we are like a lichen, and you are the algae who capture the sunshine!”\n\nIn 2003, Herb taught Elisa Vescovi and Mike Tanner how to subsample a short core. Northern Apennines, Abetone, Lago di Greppo (Vescovi et al. 2010).\n\n\n\n\nWhat better place than the BWCA to do some editing?\n\n\n\nHere, in the early morning, whilst others are still asleep…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the afternoon…\n\n\n\nand in the evening (photos: Christopher Wright).\n\n\nWhen I got my manuscripts back from Herb they were often sprinkled with marks (like grated cheese over spaghetti) but more concise and much clearer!\nBut editing also took place at home.\n\n\n\nHerb editing chapters of the English translation of the book “Cenozoic Climatic and Environmental Changes in Russia” edited by Velichko et al. (2005)\n\n\nAlso in 2004 there was a nice visit to Barbara and Dean Hansen in Stillwater.\n\nAnd on a special table the tickets are ready for the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe 2004 Moor Excursion went toEstonia: leaders were Tiiu Koff, Mihkel Kangur and Jaan-Matti Punning.\n\n\n\nHerb and Tiiu Koff looking over the patterned Männikjärve bog\n\n\nPatterned peatlands (included in question 5) are extremely vast in northern Minnesota (Red Lake peatlands, edited by Wright et al. 1992), large and impressive in Hammarmosse, Sweden (Foster et al. 1983, 1988, 1990), and a lot smaller and rarer in the Alps. Herb helped with the coring and writing of Ammann et al. 2013.\n\n\n\nLa Grande Tsa, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\nHospitality at Hythe Street is always great!\n\n\n\nFondue with Barbara Coffin, Paul Glaser, and Emi Ito\n\n\nThough potentially dangerous!\n\n\n\nDan Engstrom wielding a sword\n\n\nBut everyone survived!\n\n\n\n\nThe 2006Moor Excursion brought us to northern Italy – to Accesa or the museum in Bergamo (leaders E.

Brigitta, Jim Almendinger, Henry Lamb, Björn E Berglund, Herb, Dan Engstrom\n\n\nThe first day was filled with symposium lectures, the second day with an excursion to the Morteratsch Glacier, and somewhere in between there was cake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb’s 90th birthday symposium excursion to the Morteratsch Glacier, Switzerland\n\n\nAnd more celebrations at Hythe Street.\n\n\n\n\nBirthday at Hythe Street!\n\n2008 also saw a visit to Bogota for the wedding of Christopher and Ingrid.\n\n\n\nYay! More cake! Another birthday at Hythe Street.\n\n\n\n\nMarch, visit to Jim Smith, the machinist who made Herb’s corers for many years (and still does).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitto the Science Museum and its great omnitheatre show in 2012.\n\nWe enjoyed the hospitality of Barbara Coffin and Dan Engstrom.\n\n\n\n\nMany came to Minnesota for the ESA Conference.\n\n\n\nHerb, Jacqueline van Leeuwen, Feng Sheng Hu, Willy Tinner, Marco Conedera (Photo: Pim van der Knaap)\n\n\nSeptember 13th 2013 – a nice birthday at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand at the Bell Museum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirthday with Carrie Jennings and Vania\n\nand at Barbara’s and Dan’s place with Eric Grimm, Jim Almendinger and Paul Glaser.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 13th, Herb’s 98th birthday.\n\nHerb on his 98th birthday.

Then Jim Clark, after completing his thesis in Minnesota, showed us that we were wrong (Clark et al. 1989). At Schleinsee, Jim Clark found a remarkable fire history! Herb asked question 1: “Do you have a fire history in the Alps?” The answer was: “Sorry, we do not know”. So Herb helped to write a proposal to the Swiss NSF – which enabled Willy Tinner  to work out the Holocene fire history for the southern Alps (Tinner et al. 1998, 1999) and  Madlena Beckmann reconstructed the fire history of the central-Alpine dry valley of Valais (Colombaroli et al. 2013).\n\n\n\nHerb cycling around Schleinsee, southern Germany\n\n\nMy first of many visits to 1426 Hythe Street, St Paul – a wonderful place for MANY reasons.\n\n\n\nHerb at his home"

At small spatial scales (e.g. pingos or patterned peatlands (see 2004)) and at large scales (e.g. the huge river terraces of the Katun River or the giant ripples in the Kuray Basin in the Altai). Ripples remind us of the Channelled Scablands in Washington US (picture in Wright 2005). Pavel Borodavko is a great geomorphologist and can explain the various hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1998 Moor Excursion went to Ontario (guided by Jock McAndrews & Jean-Nicolas Haas).\n\nIn September, a second coring trip to Lagoa Rasa on the Azores (Connor et al. 2012).\n\n\n\nHerb with André Pugin, Stéphanie Girardclos and Michael Wehrli\n\n\nIn 1998 Herb visited the famous Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland and its moraines of the Younger Dryas and 1850."

One evening when we were all sitting around the campfire one of the students asked me: “Is it not strange for the American professor to sit by an open fire?” No, he does that on at least 300 days of the year, be it indoors or outdoors!\n\n\n\nAt Teplice Skalv\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the campfire\n\n\nNear Uzun Kol we met N. Lashchinsky from Novosibirsk and three colleagues from Göttingen, B. Meyer, F. Lehmkuhl, F.

The most popular means of transport in this country is also used during the excursion. Bas van Geel was somewhat worried and asked: “Is it not too much for Herb?” Answer: “Herb is a more experienced biker than most of us – from Hythe Street to Pillsbury Hall he makes 2 x 7 km per day!"
